36184577,Selection and validation of reference genes for qPCR analysis of differentiation and maturation of THP-1 cells into M1 macrophage-like cells.,"Ren Guoqiang, Juhl Morten, Peng Qiuyue, Fink Trine, Porsborg Simone Riis","For cell-based assays studying monocytes and macrophages, the immortalized monocyte cell line THP-1 is widely used and stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or interferon-γ (IFN-γ), after which it differentiates and polarizes into proinflammatory M1-like macrophages. For the quantification of this and the effect of different factors affecting these processes, the expression levels of various maturation markers are determined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. For this purpose, stably expressed reference genes are crucial. However, no studies evaluating the stability of reference genes in THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS and IFN-γ have been performed. Therefore, this paper describes the selection of the most used reference genes [RPL37A (ribosomal protein L37a), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), UBC (ubiquitin C), B2M (0β2-microbulin), ACTB (β-actin) and PPIA (cyclophilin A)], the in silico primer design, the analysis and the validation of these in accordance with the MIQE (Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments) guidelines and more recent recommendations for the validation of the stability of reference genes. Using the RefFinder platform, including the four most popular algorithms for reference gene validation, the Delta CT, BestKeeper, NormFinder and geNorm, we find the reference genes GAPDH and UBC to be the most stable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the normalization of gene expression data using the least stable reference genes, ACTB and B2M, dramatically affects the interpretation of experimental data. Taken together, it is vital to validate the stability of reference genes under the specific experimental conditions used when utilizing the THP-1 monocyte model system.",Immunology and cell biology,2022.0,United States,10.1111/imcb.12590,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Humans, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, THP-1 Cells, Lipopolysaccharides, Macrophages, Monocytes, Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate, Gene Expression Profiling","Interferon-γ, M1 macrophage-like cells, RT-qPCR, THP-1, lipopolysaccharide, reference gene","[reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, stably expressed reference genes, RPL37A, GAPDH, UBC, B2M, ACTB, PPIA, in silico primer design, MIQE guidelines, NormFinder, geNorm, Delta CT, BestKeeper, RefFinder]","THP-1 [immortalized monocyte cell line], monocytes, macrophages, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), RPL37A (ribosomal protein L37a), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), UBC (ubiquitin C), B2M (β2-microbulin), ACTB (β-actin), PPIA (cyclophilin A)"

In this work, we evaluated nineteen genes of different functional classes using Real Time Human Reference Gene Panel (Roche Applied Sciences), to identify the internal housekeeping genes (HKGs) most suitable for gene expression normalization data in human cell lines. Normal cell lines CCD-19LU (lung fibroblast), HEK-293 (epithelial cell of embryonic kidney), WI-26 VA4 (lung fibroblast), and human cancer cells, BT-549 (breast cancer), Hs 578T (breast cancer), MACL-1 (breast cancer), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), U-87 MG (glioblastoma/astrocytoma), RKO-AS45-1 (colorectal carcinoma), and TOV-21G (ovarian adenocarcinoma) were cultivated according to manufacturer's protocol. Twelve candidate reference genes were commonly expressed in five cell lines (CCD-19Lu, HEK-293, RKO-AS45-1, TOV-21G, and U-87 MG). To verify the expression stability, we used the RefFinder web tool, which integrates data from the computational programs Normfinder, BestKeeper, geNorm, and the comparative Delta-Ct method. The ACTB was the most stable reference gene to the CCD-19Lu and HEK-293 cells. The best combination of HKGs for the RKO-AS45-1 and TOV-21G cell lines were B2M/GAPDH and PBGD/B2M, respectively. For the U-87 MG cells, GAPDH and IPO8 were the most suitable HKGs.

Xenopus laevis is a popular amphibian model for studying vertebrate embryogenesis and development. Further, X. laevis is ideal for studying thyroid signaling due to its thyroid dependent metamorphosis, a stage comparable to birth in humans. When using PCR based studies, a primary concern is the choice of reference genes. Commonly used references are eef1a1, odc1, rpl8, and actnB, although there is a lack of ad hoc reference genes for X. laevis. Here, we used previously published RNA-seq data on different X. laevis stages and identified the top 14 candidate genes with respect to their expression levels as a function of developmental stage and degree of variation. We further evaluated the stability of these and other candidate genes using RT-qPCR on various stages including the unfertilised eggs, whole embryos during early development and brains during late development. We used four different statistical software packages: deltaCT, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper.

It is drought-resistant, saline-alkali resistant, extreme temperatures-resistant, and has strong adaptability. To date, the importance of this germplasm has not been sufficiently understood; therefore, it is still unclear which genes can be used as reference genes to calibrate qPCR data of N. tangutorum. In this study we analyzed the expression levels of 10 candidate reference genes (ACT, GAPDH, TUA, TUB, CYP, UBC, His, PP2A, HSP, and EF1-α) in N. tangutorum seedlings under a series of experimental conditions, including in different organs (root, stem, and leaf) and under abiotic stresses (salt, drought, heat, and cold) and hormone stimuli (abscisic acid) by qPCR. Three software programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to evaluate the expression stability of the ten genes. Comprehensive analysis showed that EF1-α and His had the best expression stability, whereas HSP was the least suitable as a reference gene.

Among many factors, the presence of cancer stem cells, a subpopulation of cells inside the tumor, has been associated with a worse prognosis. Considering the importance of gene expression studies to understand the biology of cervical cancer stem cells (CCSC), this work identifies stable reference genes for cervical cancer cell lines SiHa, HeLa, and ME180 as well as their respective cancer stem-like cells. A literature review was performed to identify validated reference genes currently used to normalize RT-qPCR data in cervical cancer cell lines. Then, cell lines were cultured in regular monolayer or in a condition that favors tumor sphere formation. RT-qPCR was performed using five reference genes: ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1, and TBP.

However, studies for elucidating growth and developmental processes at the molecular level in this species are still incipient. Performing such kinds of studies often rely on the use of the RT-qPCR, which is a highly sensitivity technique, but whose parameters must be carefully planned for achieving reliable data. Among the crucial parameters required for achieving reliable results through this technique, the use of appropriated and validated reference genes is one the most important, constituting a bottleneck, mainly in species where molecular studies are scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the best reference genes for RT-qPCR gene expression studies in C. viswanathii grown in culture media containing four different carbon sources (Olive oil, Triolein, Tributyrin, and Glucose). Eleven candidate reference genes (ACT, GPH1, AGL9, RPB2, SAP1, PGK1, TAF10, UBC13, TFC1, UBP6, and FBA1) were analyzed for their expression patterns and stability. Analysis of gene expression stability was performed using the RefFinder tool, which integrates the geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and Delta-Ct algorithms, and validation of the results was performed through analyzing the expression of a lipase gene, CvLIP4. Analyzing the four treatments together, CvACT and CvRPB2 constituted the best reference gene pair. When treatments are analyzed individually, CvRPB2/CvACT, CvFBA1/CvAGL9, CvPGK1/CvAGL9 and CvACT/CvRPB2 were the best reference gene pairs for the culture media containing olive oil, triolein, tributyrin, and glucose as carbon sources, respectively.

This study aimed to screen the best internal reference genes for the real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in leaves and roots of switchgrass for investigating its response to various heavy metals, such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), chromium (Cr), and arsenic (As). The stability of fourteen candidate reference genes was evaluated by BestKeeper, GeNorm, NormFinder, and RefFinder software. Our results identified <i>U2AF</i> as the best reference gene in Cd, Hg, Cr, and As treated leaves as well as in Hg, Pb, As, and Cr stressed root tissues.

The basis for this adaptability remains to be investigated at the transcriptomic level using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Selection of a reliable gene for the normalization of qPCR data is important for obtaining accurate results in gene expression. The goal of this study was to identify an appropriate reference gene from 12 candidate genes for gene expression analysis in black locust exposed to various stressors such as abscisic acid (ABA), NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and varying temperatures. In GeNorm and NormFinder analyses, ACT (actin) and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene expression were the most stable in all conditions except heat stress, but in BestKeeper analysis, GAPDH and helicase gene expression were the most stable under NaCl and heat stress. In contrast, ACT and GAPDH were highest under abscisic acid (ABA), GAPDH and βTUB (beta tubulin) under cold stress, and helicase and EF1α (elongation factor 1 alpha) under PEG stress. We found that the most stable reference gene combination for all conditions was ACT and GAPDH.

Species within this genus are clinically, agriculturally and biotechnologically relevant, leading to increasing interest in elucidating gene expression dynamics of key metabolic and physiological processes. Reverse-transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) is a sensitive and specific method of quantifying gene expression. A crucial step for comparing RT-qPCR results between strains and experimental conditions is normalisation to experimentally validated reference gene(s). In this review, we provide a critical analysis of current reference gene selection and validation practices for RT-qPCR gene expression analyses of <i>Aspergillus</i>. Of 90 primary research articles obtained through our PubMed query, 17 experimentally validated the reference gene(s) used. Twenty reference genes were used across the 90 studies, with beta-tubulin being the most used reference gene, followed by actin, 18S rRNA and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Sixteen of the 90 studies used multiple reference genes for normalisation. Failing to experimentally validate the stability of reference genes can lead to conflicting results, as was the case for four studies.

In different organs, gene expression patterns can provide clues to understanding the biological functions. For rapid and accurate quantification of gene expression, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) has become one of the most widely used methods. However, the success of qPCR data normalization depends on the use of a suitable reference gene and a single reference gene is not universally suitable for all the experiments. Therefore, reference gene validation is a crucial step for different organ tissues of chicken where suitable reference genes for qPCR analysis in varieties of tissues have not been investigated exhaustively so far. In this study, we have selected 30 Gallus gallus candidate reference genes from NCBI, amplified and studied their expression profiles by qPCR in different organ tissues (breast muscle, thigh muscle, heart, liver, spleen, gizzard, and bursa) of chicken. The result showed that, for breast muscle HSP10 and RPL23, thigh muscle RPL14 and RPL13, liver ALB and HSP70, spleen ALB and GAPDH, heart CYCS and TUBA8B, gizzard RPL5 and 18S rRNA, and bursa EEF1A1 and PGK2 are most stable genes respectively. The results also showed that for different organ tissues, individual or a combination of reference genes should be selected for data normalization.

However, while reference gene selection has been a topic of publications, this issue is often disregarded when measuring target mRNA expression. Therefore, we (1) evaluated the frequency of appropriate reference gene selection, (2) suggest an easy-to-use tool for least variability reference gene selection, (3) demonstrate application of this tool, and (4) show effects on target gene expression profiles. All 2015 published articles in Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology were screened for the use of quantitative real-time PCR analysis and selection of reference genes. Target gene expression (Vegfa, Grk2, Sirt4, and Timp3) in H9c2 cells was analyzed following various interventions (hypoxia, hyperglycemia, and/or isoflurane exposure with and without subsequent hypoxia) in relation to putative reference genes (Actb, Gapdh, B2m, Sdha, and Rplp1) using the least variability method vs. an arbitrarily selected but established reference gene. In the vast majority (18 of 21) of papers, no information was provided regarding selection of an appropriate reference gene. In only 1 of 21 papers, a method of appropriate reference gene selection was described and in 2 papers reference gene selection remains unclear. The method of reference gene selection had major impact on interpretation of target gene expression.

The selection of appropriate endogenous reference genes as normalizers for the relative quantification of miRNA expression levels using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) is essential to avoid errors and improve the comparability of miRNA expression level data among different body fluids. In this study, small RNAs were isolated from individual donations of five forensically relevant body fluids (peripheral blood, menstrual blood, saliva, semen and vaginal secretions). Thirty-seven samples were subjected to high-throughput miRNA sequencing. By combining our results with those obtained through a literature investigation, 28 candidate RNAs were identified. Following RTqPCR validation, the candidate RNAs were preliminarily evaluated in 15 samples to exclude miRNAs with low expression and high variation. Then, the expression levels of 10 relatively stable candidate reference RNAs in 100 samples were determined and further analysed using four commonly employed programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and ΔCq). According to the comprehensive stability rankings of the four algorithms, miR-320a-3p was validated as the most stable endogenous reference gene among the five forensically relevant body fluids, followed by miR-484, SNORD43, miR-320c and RNU6b. Moreover, the combined application of miR-320a-3p with RNU6b could increase the normalization effect. In addition, a total of 56 mock samples placed outdoors and indoors for different times were prepared to further evaluate the stability of candidate reference RNAs, and miR-320a-3p remained the preferred reference gene. Furthermore, the relative expression levels of publicly accepted body fluid-specific miRNAs were determined in 30 samples to verify the practicality and effectiveness of the reference genes.

Although numerous statistical approaches have been proposed to determine the best reference genes, they can give rise to conflicting results depending on experimental conditions. Hence, recent studies propose the use of RNA-Seq to identify stable genes followed by the application of different statistical approaches to determine the best set of reference genes for qPCR data normalization.

But what can we learn from age-invariant genes-those that remain unchanged throughout the aging process? These genes also have a practical application: they serve as reference genes (often called housekeeping genes) in expression studies. Reference genes have mostly been identified and validated in young organisms, and no systematic investigation has been done across the lifespan. Here, we build upon a common pipeline for identifying reference genes in RNA-seq datasets to identify age-invariant genes across seventeen C57BL/6 mouse tissues (brain, lung, bone marrow, muscle, white blood cells, heart, small intestine, kidney, liver, pancreas, skin, brown, gonadal, marrow, and subcutaneous adipose tissue) spanning 1 to 21+ months of age. We identify 9 pan-tissue age-invariant genes and many tissue-specific age-invariant genes. These genes are stable across the lifespan and are validated in independent bulk RNA-seq datasets and RT-qPCR. We find age-invariant genes have shorter transcripts on average and are enriched for CpG islands. Interestingly, pathway enrichment analysis for age-invariant genes identifies an overrepresentation of molecular functions associated with some, but not all, hallmarks of aging. Thus, though hallmarks of aging typically involve changes in cell maintenance mechanisms, select genes associated with these hallmarks resist fluctuations in expression with age. Finally, our analysis concludes no classical reference gene is appropriate for aging studies in all tissues.

Reliable q-PCR results depend on proper data normalization, which requires the use of stable reference genes. Yam, valued as both food and medicine, has significant commercial and economic potential. Its cultivation is being actively promoted in the central and western regions of Inner Mongolia. However, studies have shown that no reference gene is universally stable under all conditions. Therefore, screening and validating suitable reference genes are essential for accurately studying gene expression patterns in yam.

The quality of an RT-qPCR assay is dependent upon the identification and validation of reference genes to normalize gene expression data. The so-called housekeeping genes are commonly used as internal reference genes because they are assumed to be ubiquitously expressed at stable levels. Commonly, researchers do not validate their reference genes but rely on historical reference genes or previously validated genes from an unrelated experiment. Using previously validated reference genes to assess gene expression changes occurring during malting resulted in extensive variability. Therefore, a new method was tested and validated to circumvent the use of internal reference genes. Total mouse RNA was chosen as the external reference RNA and a suite of primer sets to putatively stable mouse genes was created to identify stably expressed genes for use as an external reference gene. cDNA was created by co-amplifying total mouse RNA, as an RNA spike-in, and barley RNA. When using the external reference genes to normalize malting gene expression data, standard deviations were significantly reduced and significant differences in transcript abundance were observed, whereas when using the internal reference genes, standard deviations were larger with no significant differences seen. Furthermore, external reference genes were more accurate at assessing expression levels in malting and developing grains, whereas the internal reference genes overestimated abundance in developing grains and underestimated abundance in malting grains.",Biology methods & protocols,2023.0,England,10.1093/biomethods/bpad034,Journal Article,,"barley, grain development, malting, normalization, real-time PCR, spike-in RNA","[RT-qPCR, 2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> method, co-amplification, external reference RNA, suite of primer sets, total mouse RNA, putatively stable mouse genes, RNA spike-in, barley RNA]","[mouse, barley]

This study investigated genes with consistent expression patterns in the chicken oviduct, encompassing both individual oviduct tract tissues and the entire oviduct, by utilizing multiple RNA-seq datasets. The screening results revealed the discovery of 100 novel reference genes in each segment of oviduct tissues, primarily associated with cell cycle regulation and RNA binding. Moreover, the majority of housekeeping genes (HKGs) showed inconsistent expression levels across distinct samples, suggesting their lack of stability under varying conditions. The stability of the newly identified reference genes was assessed in comparison to previously validated stable reference genes in chicken oviduct and commonly utilized HKGs, employing traditional reference gene screening methods. HERPUD2, CSDE1, VPS35, PBRM1, LSM14A, and YWHAB were identified to be suitable novel reference gene for different parts of the oviduct. HERPUD2 and YWHAB were reliable for gene expression normalization throughout the oviduct tract. Furthermore, overexpression and interference assays in DF1 cells showed LSM14A and YWHAB play a crucial role in cell proliferation, highlighting the importance of these newly reference genes for further research. Overall, this study has expanded the options for reference genes in RT-qPCR experiments in different segments of the chicken oviduct and the entire oviduct.",Poultry science,2024.0,England,10.1016/j.psj.2024.103980,Journal Article,"Animals, Chickens, Female, Oviducts, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Genes, Essential, Avian Proteins, Reference Standards, Gene Expression Profiling","RNA-seq, RT-qPCR, chicken, oviduct, stable reference gene","[RNA-seq data analysis, screening for ideal reference genes, identification of optimal reference genes in chicken oviduct, investigation of genes with consistent expression patterns, multiple RNA-seq datasets, discovery of 100 novel reference genes, cell cycle regulation, RNA binding, traditional reference gene screening methods, HERPUD2, CSDE1, VPS35, PBRM1, LSM14A, YWHAB, gene expression normalization, overexpression and interference assays in DF1 cells, cell proliferation]","Chicken [oviduct (including the infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, uterus, and vagina)], DF1 cells."

For an intensive investigation of the seasonal and labor-dependent expression patterns of its genes, accurate quantification of the target gene transcription level is a fundamental step. To date, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has been widely used for rapid quantification of gene transcripts, with reliable reference gene(s) for normalization. To this end, in an attempt to search for reliable reference genes, the amplification efficiencies of six candidate reference genes (rp49, rpL32, rpS18, tbp, tub, and gapdh) were determined. Subsequently, four genes (rpL32, rpS18, tbp, and gapdh) with PCR efficiencies of 90% to 110% were evaluated for their expression stabilities with three programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) and used for normalization of seasonal expression patterns of target genes in the forager and nurse heads. Although the three programs revealed slightly different results, two genes, rpS18 and gapdh, were suggested to be the optimal reference genes for qRT-PCR-based determination of seasonal and labor-specific gene expression profiles. Furthermore, the combined use of these two genes yielded a more accurate normalization, compared with the use of a single gene in the head of honey bee.

Expression of target genes is normalized to expression of stable reference genes to account for sample preparation variability. Thus, the identification and validation of stably expressed reference genes is crucial for making accurate, quantitative, statistical conclusions in gene expression studies. Traditional housekeeping genes identified decades ago based on high and relatively stable expression are often used, although many have shown these to not be valid, particularly in highly dynamic systems such as stem cell differentiation. In this study we outline a rational approach to identify stable reference genes valid throughout human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation to hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Several publicly available transcriptomic data sets were analyzed to identify genes with low variability in expression throughout differentiation. These putative novel reference genes were subsequently validated in RT-qPCR analyses to assess their stability under various perturbations, including maturation during extended culture, lactate purification, and various differentiation efficiencies. Expression in hPSC-CMs was also compared with whole human heart tissue. A core set of three novel reference genes (<i>EDF1</i>, <i>DDB1</i>, and <i>ZNF384</i>) exhibited robust stability across the conditions tested, whereas expression of the traditional housekeeping genes tested (<i>ACTB</i>, <i>B2M</i>, <i>GAPDH</i>, and <i>RPL13A</i>) varied significantly under these conditions.

The findings suggested that the most reliable normalization can be achieved by selecting the two reference genes for all conditions, with the optimal pairs being <i>RPS10</i> and <i>RPL32</i> for the developmental stage, <i>RPS10</i> and <i>RPS15</i> for tissue, <i>RPS10</i> and <i>RPS15</i> for the host, and <i>EF1-α</i> and <i>RPL13</i> for temperature. Also, the best and least stable reference genes were chosen to compare the relative transcript levels of the <i>TBX1</i> in various tissues, which exhibited considerable variation.

Amplification of pseudogenes along with gene of interest often produces false positive results, which is an innate problem in Reverse Transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Selecting a reference gene without any interference from pseudogene amplification is therefore a challenge to overcome. Among the common reference genes used for normalization (ACTB, GAPDH, HPRT1, TUBB, RNA18SN1 and B2M), B2M was found to have no pseudogenes in silico, which has also been confirmed by PCR and RT-qPCR. We also assessed the effect of pseudogenes on the determination of the stability of reference genes through data mining. The phylogenetic analysis of pseudogenes and functional genes revealed high sequence similarity among mammals. In addition, we demonstrated the deduction of pseudogene amplification signal using ValidPrime Assay (VPA) under conditions where genomic DNA contamination could not be avoided.

But what can we learn from age-invariant genes-those that remain unchanged throughout the aging process? These genes also have a practical application: they can serve as reference genes in expression studies. Reference genes have mostly been identified and validated in young organisms, and no systematic investigation has been done across the lifespan. Here, we build upon a common pipeline for identifying reference genes in RNA-seq datasets to identify age-invariant genes across seventeen C57BL/6 mouse tissues (brain, lung, bone marrow, muscle, white blood cells, heart, small intestine, kidney, liver, pancreas, skin, brown, gonadal, marrow, and subcutaneous adipose tissue) spanning 1 to 21+ months of age. We identify 9 pan-tissue age-invariant genes, and many tissue-specific age-invariant genes. These genes are stable across the lifespan and are validated in independent bulk RNA-seq datasets and RT-qPCR. Age-invariant genes have shorter transcripts and are enriched for CpG islands. Interestingly, pathway enrichment analysis for age-invariant genes identifies an overrepresentation of molecular functions associated with some, but not all, hallmarks of aging. Thus, even though hallmarks of aging typically involve change, select genes associated with these hallmarks resist age-related change. Finally, our analysis provides a list of murine tissues where classical reference genes are appropriate for application in aging studies. However, no classical reference gene is appropriate across all aging tissues.

In spite of the efforts to clarify the relationship among genetic factors and susceptibility to develop OP, many genetic associations need to be further functionally validated. Besides, some limitations as the choice of stably expressed reference genes (RG) should be overcome to ensure the quality and reproducibility of gene expression assays. To our knowledge, a validation study for RG in OP is still missing. We compared the expression levels, using polymerase chain reaction quantitative real time (qPCR) of 10 RG (G6PD, B2M, GUSB, HSP90, EF1A, RPLP0, GAPDH, ACTB, 18 S and HPRT1) to assess their suitability in OP analysis by using GeNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder programs. A minimal number of two RG was recommended by GeNorm to obtain a reliable normalization.

The use of reference genes is the most common method to normalize RT-qPCR assays; however, many studies have reported that the expression of frequently used reference genes is more variable than expected, depending on experimental conditions. Consequently, proper validation of the stability of reference genes is an essential step when performing new gene expression studies. Despite the fact that RT-qPCR has been widely used to elucidate molecular correlates of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), up to date there are no reports demonstrating validation of reference genes for the evaluation of changes in gene expression after NIHL. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the expression of some commonly used reference genes (Arbp, b-Act, b2m, CyA, Gapdh, Hprt1, Tbp, Tfrc and UbC) and examined their suitability as endogenous control genes for RT-qPCR analysis in the adult Wistar rat in response to NIHL. Four groups of rats were noise-exposed to generate permanent cochlear damage. Cochleae were collected at different time points after noise exposure and the expression level of candidate reference genes was evaluated by RT-qPCR using geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper software to determine expression stability. The three independent applications revealed Tbp as the most stably expressed reference gene.

We showed that simple selection of the reference gene or pair of genes with the lowest stability value from the pool of potential reference genes-a commonly used approach-is not sufficient to accurately and reliably normalize the target gene transcript and can lead to biologically incorrect conclusions. For reliable assessment of changes in a target gene expression level, we propose our innovative GenExpA software, which works in a manner independent of the experimental model and the normalizer used. GenExpA software selects the best reference by combining the NormFinder algorithm with progressive removal of the least stable gene from the candidate genes in a given experimental model and in the set of daughter models assigned to it. The reliability of references is validated based on the consistency of the statistical analyses of normalized target gene expression levels through all models, described by the coherence score (CS). The use of the CS value imparts a new quality to qPCR analysis because it clarifies how low the stability value of reference must be in order for biologically correct conclusions to be drawn.

After amplification specificity validation, 32 candidates were selected and further evaluated by RT-qPCR using samples from various organs subjected to NaCl, drought, heat, waterlogging, and chilling stress. Four strategies, including delta-CT, BestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder, were used to rank the stability of reference genes, and the ranks produced by these four strategies were comprehensively evaluated by RefFinder to determine the final rank. Overall, the top three stability reference genes indicated by RefFinder were <i>RBP</i> > <i>ATPase</i> > <i>40S_S3</i>. Their expression pattern correlation analysis showed that the coefficients among each pair of <i>RBP</i>, <i>ATPase</i>, and <i>40S_S3</i> were larger than 0.96, revealing consistent and stable expression patterns under various treatments. Then, the expression of three <i>pathogenesis-related</i> (<i>PR</i>) genes and seven <i>MYB</i> genes in rhizomes during postharvest storage and subjected to pathogen infection was normalized by <i>RBP</i>, <i>ATPase</i>, <i>40S_S3</i>, <i>RBP</i> and <i>ATPase</i>, <i>ATPase</i> and <i>40S-S3</i>, and <i>RBP</i> and <i>40S-S3</i>. The results showed that <i>PR</i> and <i>MYB</i> genes were induced by postharvest deterioration and pathogen infection. The correlation coefficients of <i>RBP</i>/<i>ATPase</i>, <i>RBP</i>/<i>40S_S3</i>, <i>ATPase</i>/<i>40S_S3</i>, <i>RBP</i> and <i>ATPase/ATPase</i> and <i>40S-S3</i>, <i>RBP</i> and <i>ATPase/RBP</i> and <i>40S-S3</i>, and <i>ATPase</i> and <i>40S-S3/RBP</i> and <i>40S-S3</i> were 0.99, 0.96, 0.99, 0.99, 1.00, and 1.00, respectively, which confirmed the stability of these three reference genes in postharvest biology studies of ginger.

Analytical accuracy, precision and reliability are critically dependent on the selection of internal control reference genes. In this study, the authors have identified optimal reference genes that can be utilised universally for qPCR analysis of CHO cell mRNAs. Initially, transcriptomic datasets were analysed to identify eight endogenous genes that exhibited high expression stability across four distinct CHO cell lines sampled in different culture phases. The relative transcript abundance of each gene in 20 diverse, commonly applied experimental conditions was then determined by qPCR analysis. Utilizing GeNorm, BestKeeper and NormFinder algorithms, the authors identified four mRNAs (Gnb1, Fkbp1a, Tmed2 and Mmadhc) that exhibited a highly stable level of expression across all conditions, validating their utility as universally applicable reference genes. Whilst any combination of only two genes can be generally used for normalisation of qPCR data, the authors show that specific combinations of reference genes are particularly suited to discrete experimental conditions. In summary, the authors report the identification of fully validated universal reference genes, optimised primer sequences robust to genomic mutations and simple reference gene pair selection guidelines that enable streamlined qPCR analyses of mRNA abundance in CHO cells with maximum accuracy and precision.",Biotechnology journal,2018.0,Germany,10.1002/biot.201700259,Journal Article,"Algorithms, Animals, CHO Cells, Cricetinae, Cricetulus, Gene Expression Profiling, RNA, Messenger, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards, Transcriptome","Chinese hamster ovary cells, expression stability, gene expression, qPCR, reference genes","Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), GeNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder, transcriptomic datasets, qPCR analysis, internal control reference genes, mRNAs (Gnb1, Fkbp1a, Tmed2 and Mmadhc)","CHO cells (specifically four distinct CHO cell lines), Gnb1, Fkbp1a, Tmed2, Mmadhc."

Therefore, systematic evaluation of reference genes is necessary. With the aim to identify optimum reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression in different tissues of Panax ginseng and the seedlings grown under heat stress, we investigated the expression stability of eight candidate reference genes, including elongation factor 1-beta (EF1-β), elongation factor 1-gamma (EF1-γ), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3G1 (IF3G1), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3B (IF3B), actin (ACT), actin11 (ACT11), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and cyclophilin ABH-like protein (CYC), using four widely used computational programs: geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative ΔCt method. The results were then integrated using the web-based tool RefFinder. As a result, EF1-γ, IF3G1, and EF1-β were the three most stable genes in different tissues of P. ginseng, while IF3G1, ACT11, and GAPDH were the top three-ranked genes in seedlings treated with heat. Using three better reference genes alone or in combination as internal control, we examined the expression profiles of MAR, a multiple function-associated mRNA-like non-coding RNA (mlncRNA) in P. ginseng.

The lepidopteran insect undergoes major modifications in the central nervous system (CNS) so as to adapt to the lifestyle of these distinct stages with specific habitats and functions from voraciously feeding larval stages to flying reproductive adults via dormant pupal stages. Such transitions are linked to transcriptional, epigenetic, and translational complexities. Therefore, studying rhythmic gene expression in CNS of various developmental stages and the effects of antagonists on developmental hormones requires a very stable reference gene (RG). To facilitate rhythmic gene expression studies using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in <i>B. mori</i> and the effect of developmental hormone juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxy ecdysone hormone (20 HE), antagonists Precocene 1 and testosterone, respectively, were used.

To better understand the impact of the immune system on the pathophysiology of individuals infected with Ascaris suum, mice have been used as experimental models. The RT-qPCR technique is a critical auxiliary tool of investigation used to quantify mRNA levels. However, proper normalization using reference genes is essential to ensure reliable outcomes to avoid analytical errors and false results. Despite the importance of reference genes for experimental A. suum infection studies, no specific reference genes have been identified yet. Therefore, we conducted a study to assess five potential reference genes (GAPDH, 18s, ACTB, B2M, and HPRT1) in different tissues (liver, lungs, small and large intestines) affected by A. suum larval migration in C57BL/6j mice. Tissue collection was carried out to analyze parasite burden and confirm the presence of larvae during the peak of migration in each tissue. Upon confirmation, we analyzed different genes in the tissues and found no common gene with stable expression. Our results highlight the importance of analyzing different genes and using different software programs to ensure reliable relative expression results. Based on our findings, B2M was ranked as the ideal reference gene for the liver, while 18S was the most stable gene in the lung and small intestine. ACTB, or a combination of ACTB with GAPDH, was deemed suitable as reference genes for the large intestine due to their stable expression and less variation between the control and infected groups. To further demonstrate the impact of using different reference genes, we normalized the expression of a chemokine gene (CXCL9) in all tissues. Significant differences in CXCL9 expression levels were observed between different groups in all tissues except for the large intestine. This underscores the importance of selecting appropriate reference genes to avoid overestimating target gene expression levels and encountering normalization-related issues that can lead to false results.

It is common to use constitutively expressed endogenous reference genes (RGs) for normalization, but for this strategy to be valid the RGs must be stably expressed across all the tested samples. Here, we have tested 10 common RGs for their expression stability in cerebral cortex from young rats after in utero exposure to thyroid hormone (TH) disrupting compounds. We found that all 10 RGs were stable according to the three algorithms geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. The downstream target gene <i>Pvalb</i> was significantly downregulated in brains from young rats after in utero exposure to propylthiouracil (PTU), a medicinal drug inhibiting TH synthesis. Similar results were obtained regardless of which of the 10 RGs was used for normalization. Another potential gene affected by developmental TH disruption, <i>Dio2</i>, was either not affected, or significantly upregulated about 1.4-fold, depending on which RG was used for normalization. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting correct RGs for normalization and to take into account the sensitivity of the RT-qPCR method when reporting on changes to gene expression that are less than 1.5-fold. For future studies examining relative gene expression in rat cerebral cortex under toxicological conditions, we recommend using a combination of either <i>Rps18/Rpl13a</i> or <i>Rps18/Ubc</i> for normalization, but also continuously monitor any potential regulation of the RGs themselves following alterations to study protocols.",PeerJ,2019.0,United States,10.7717/peerj.7181,Journal Article,,"Brain, Cortex, Gene expression, Housekeeping gene, Rat, Reference gene, Toxicology, qPCR","geNorm algorithm, NormFinder algorithm, BestKeeper algorithm, quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) experiments, constitutively expressed endogenous reference genes (RGs), Pvalb gene, Dio2 gene, Rps18 gene, Rpl13a gene, Ubc gene.","Rats [young rats], Thyroid hormone (TH), Propylthiouracil (PTU), <i>Pvalb</i> gene, <i>Dio2</i> gene, <i>Rps18</i> gene, <i>Rpl13a</i> gene, <i>Ubc</i> gene."

Insights into the biological features of OA are obtained by characterization of the molecular features by gene expression profiling using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). However, it has recently become evident that the use of suitable reference genes is required for appropriate normalization of this technique. Here total RNA was isolated from the synovium of 18 men and 20 women who underwent total knee arthroplasty for knee OA (KOA). We validated the expression stability of 7 candidate housekeeping genes (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPL13A, SDHA, and YWHAZ) in the synovium of KOA with 3 commonly used algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper). Additionally, we evaluated expression profiles of the steroid hormone receptor (AR, ESR1, ESR2, GR, MR, and PR) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B and IL6) genes in the synovium and their correlations with the risk factors of KOA, using the most and least stable housekeeping genes for comparison. Results showed that HPRT1 was the most stable gene, whereas B2M was the least stable. RT-qPCR analysis revealed sexually dimorphic expression of AR, IL1B, and IL6; intercorrelations between steroid hormone receptor expression levels and female-specific correlations of IL1B expression with ESR1 and PR expression, IL6 expression with ESR1 and GR expression, and body mass index with AR and PR expression; and the choice of the least stable reference gene altered several correlations and statistical significances.

The determination of gene expression profiles in multiple tissue/organ samples could provide valuable clues towards understanding the potential biological functions of chemical changes in these plants. Studies on gene expression by RT-qPCR require particularly careful selection of suitable reference genes as a control for normalization. Here, we provide a study for the identification of reliable reference genes in P. arboreum, P. gaudichaudianum, P. malacophyllum, and P. tuberculatum, at two different life stages: 2-month-old seedlings and adult plants. To do this, annotated sequences were recovered from transcriptome datasets of the above listed Piper spp. These sequences were subjected to expression analysis using RT-qPCR, followed by analysis using the geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. A set of five genes were identified showing stable expression: ACT7 (Actin-7), Cyclophilin (Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase), EF1α (Elongation factor 1-alpha), RNABP (RNA-binding protein), and UBCE (Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme).

RT-qPCR is the most commonly used method for studying microRNA expression, with the accuracy and reliability of results depending on the use of an appropriate reference gene for normalization. This study aimed to evaluate seven miRNAs (U6, Let-7a, miR-23a, miR-25-3, miR-103, miR-99-5, and miR-455) expression stability in different tissues of Nile tilapia subjected to osmotic stress. Fish were divided into two groups: a control and an experimental group, raised in 0 and 12 ppt salinity water respectively.

The method of KH Sadek and the GeNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder software were used to evaluate the stability of gene expression in both pyometra and healthy uterine samples. The results showed that the expression stability of the candidate gene in pyometra and healthy tissues differed. We showed that YWHAZ was the best reference gene, which could be used as an accurate internal control gene in canine pyometra studies. To further validate this recommendation, the expression profile of a target gene insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor gene (IGF1R) was investigated.

It is also crucial to select internal controls carefully and evaluate their stability for effective normalization and accurate interpretation of the results. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we assessed the stability of six commonly used housekeeping genes: GAPDH, Actb, HPRT, HMBS, 18S, and 36B4. We analyzed their variability in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with supernatants from newly isolated <i>Lacticaseibacillus paracasei</i> strains.

Therefore, this study aimed to identify stably expressed genes for their potential use as RGs in pepper fruit studies. Initially, a total of 35 putative RGs were selected by mining the pepper transcriptome data sets derived from the PGP (Pepper Genome Platform) and PGD (Pepper Genome Database).

However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying this disease remain unclear. A stable reference gene is essential as an internal control for molecular biology research of this condition. Reverse-transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is considered an extremely sensitive technique used for absolute and relative quantification of target genes transcript levels. To accurately estimate the relative expression of genes in cells from mice with KYDS in response to infection with influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A/H1N1) virus using RT-qPCR, it is necessary to identify suitable reference genes. In the present study, analysis of 10 reference genes (Act-β, β2m, GAPDH, Gusβ, Tubα, Grcc10, Eif4h, Rnf187, Nedd8 and Ywhae) was performed across a set of 4 tissue types: Lung; heart; liver; and kidney. KYDS mice were inoculated with A/H1N1 virus or a mock control. For analysis, geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and Bio-Rad Maestro<sup>™</sup> statistical programs were used for the estimation of the stability of the reference genes. The results were authenticated through extended experimental settings using a group of 10 samples, parallel to 3 additional innate immune system-associated genes of the host, TLR3, TLR7 and RIG-I, which were also analyzed using the same algorithms. From the 4 algorithms, taking into account the joint analyses of the ranking order outputs, the 2 genes Ywhae and Nedd8 were identified to be the most stable for mice with KYDS following infection with A/H1N1 virus. In contrast, the least stable genes in all 4 tissues were GAPDH and β2m.

However, it requires an accurate choice of reference genes for adequate normalization. The aim of this study was to validate the reference genes for qPCR experiments in the brain of rats in the model of mild ketosis established through supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and intermittent fasting. This approach allows to reproduce certain neuroprotective effects of the classical ketogenic diet while avoiding its adverse effects. Ketogenic treatment targets multiple metabolic pathways, which may affect the reference gene expression. The standard chow of adult Wistar rats was supplemented with MCT (2 ml/kg orogastrically, during 6 h of fasting) or water (equivolume) for 1 month. The mRNA expression of 9 housekeeping genes (Actb, B2m, Gapdh, Hprt1, Pgk1, Ppia, Rpl13a, Sdha, Ywhaz) in the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal and ventral hippocampus was measured by RT-qPCR. Using the RefFinder® online tool, we have found that the reference gene stability ranking strongly depended on the analyzed brain region. The most stably expressed reference genes were found to be Ppia, Actb, and Rpl13a in the medial prefrontal cortex; Rpl13a, Ywhaz, and Pgk1 in the dorsal hippocampus; Ywhaz, Sdha, and Ppia in the ventral hippocampus. The B2m was identified as an invalid reference gene in the ventral hippocampus, while Sdha, Actb, and Gapdh were unstable in the dorsal hippocampus.

30261649,Validation of Suitable Housekeeping Genes for the Normalization of mRNA Expression for Studying Tumor Acidosis.,"Lemma Silvia, Avnet Sofia, Meade Michael Joseph, Chano Tokuhiro, Baldini Nicola","Similar to other types of cancer, acidification of tumor microenvironment is an important feature of osteosarcoma, and a major source of cellular stress that triggers cancer aggressiveness, drug resistance, and progression. Among the different effects of low extracellular pH on tumor cells, we have recently found that short-term exposure to acidosis strongly affects gene expression. This alteration might also occur for the most commonly used housekeeping genes (HKG), thereby causing erroneous interpretation of RT-qPCR data. On this basis, by using osteosarcoma cells cultured at different pH values, we aimed to identify the ideal HKG to be considered in studies on tumor-associated acidosis. We verified the stability of 15 commonly used HKG through five algorithms (NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, ΔCT, coefficient of variation) and found that no universal HKG is suitable, since at least four HKG are necessary for proper normalization. Furthermore, according to the acceptable range of values, <i>YWHAZ</i>, <i>GAPDH</i>, <i>GUSB</i>, and <i>18S rRNA</i> were the most stable reference genes at different pH.

29922590,A PCR-based quantitative assay for the evaluation of mRNA integrity in rat samples.,"Padhi Bhaja K, Singh Manjeet, Rosales Marianela, Pelletier Guillaume, Cakmak Sabit","Reverse Transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is applied to quantify gene transcript levels in a wide range of investigations. Proper assessment of RNA integrity is essential for reliable assessment of gene expression levels, as RNA molecules are acutely vulnerable to degradation. However, RNA quality control measures are still infrequently reported in rat toxicological studies, which impede proper evaluation of gene expression data reliability. The high operational cost of microfluidic capillary electrophoresis systems along with paucity of alternative methods for the quantitative assessment of rat RNA integrity constitute potential hurdles to the systematic implementation and reporting of RNA integrity assessment in rat studies. This manuscript describes the adaptation of an alternative RT-qPCR-based 3':5' assay as an additional option for the quantitative assessment of rat RNA integrity. Two PCR primer sets were designed on the 3' and 5' regions of a rat housekeeping gene to evaluate RNA integrity by measuring the relative expression (3':5' ratio) of these amplicons. The 3':5' ratios were then compared to Agilent Bioanalyzer's RNA integrity number (RIN) for a wide range of RNA samples originating from different tissues, cultured cell lines and rat strains that were prepared freshly, stored for years at -80 °C, purchased commercially or intentionally degraded. The 3':5' ratios and RIN values presented similar assessment of RNA integrity status from intact to heavily degraded samples. Based on the LOWESS regression of this large comparison dataset, 3':5' ratio threshold criteria equivalent to RIN cut-off values can be proposed for the selection of RNA samples for RT-qPCR analyses. This qPCR-based assay is easy to implement, cost-effective, and provides a reliable quantification of RNA integrity to assist in the selection of rat RNA samples suitable for downstream RT-qPCR gene expression analyses.",Biomolecular detection and quantification,2018.0,Germany,10.1016/j.bdq.2018.02.001,Journal Article,,"Gene expression, Housekeeping gene, Pgk1, RNA integrity, Rat, Real-time quantitative PCR","RT-qPCR, 3':5' assay, PCR primer sets, Agilent Bioanalyzer, RNA integrity number (RIN), LOWESS regression.","Rat, rat housekeeping gene, cultured cell lines, rat strains."

Cottonseed value might be increased by providing high-value bioactive polyphenols for improving nutrition and health. However, there was a lack of molecular evidence for cottonseed bioactivity in mammalian cells. One widely used method for evaluating the bioactivity of natural products is quantitative real-time-PCR (qPCR). The selection of stably expressed internal reference genes is a crucial task of qPCR assay for data analysis. The rationale for reference gene selection is that a lower standard deviation of the cycle of threshold (Cq) among the treatments indicates a more stable expression of the gene. The objective of this study was to select reference genes in human colon cancer cells (COLO 205) treated with cottonseed-derived gossypol and bioactive extracts along with bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS). SYBR Green qPCR was used to analyze the mRNA levels of a wide range of biomarkers involved in glucose transport, lipid biosynthesis, inflammatory response, and cancer development. qPCR data (10,560 Cq values) were generated from 55 genes analyzed from 64 treatments with triplicate per treatment for each gene. The data showed that B-cell lymphoma 2 (<i>Bcl2</i>) mRNA was the most stable among the 55 mRNAs analyzed in the human colon cancer cells. Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (<i>Gapdh</i>) and ribosome protein L32 (<i>Rpl32</i>) mRNAs were not good qPCR references for the colon cancer cells. These observations were consistent regardless of the treatment comparison between gossypol and LPS, glanded and glandless seed extracts, seed coat and kernel extracts, or treatment for 8 and 24 h. These results suggest that <i>Bcl2</i> is a preferable reference gene for qPCR assays in human colon cancer cells treated with cottonseed-derived gossypol and bioactive extracts as well as LPS. The extensive qPCR results firmly support the conclusion that the <i>Bcl2</i> gene is stably expressed at the mRNA level in the human colon cancer cells regardless of the treatment, suggesting that <i>Bcl2</i> gene expression is not regulated at the mRNA level but at the post-transcriptional level.

However, the essential step that determines appropriate and correct data interpretation is the selection of proper endogenous control genes. Identifying useful reference genes with stable expression is critical for accurate normalization and precise results. Functional divergence of duplicated genes in tetraploid species, like common carp, can complicate the choice for a proper reference gene. In the present study, we determined the expression stability of duplicated genes of 40s, b2m, ef1α, gapdh, g6pd, and odc1 in different tissues of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). Gene expression analysis comprised healthy control fish, fish under bacterial and parasitic infections, and across the early stage of common carp development. Obtained data were compared with the actb gene, which is used widely as a reference in RT-qPCR analysis. The application of the three different algorithms - geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, allowed comparative evaluation of the expression stability of the tested genes. Subsequently, the RefFinder, a web-based tool, was used to rank the examined housekeeping genes comprehensively. We demonstrate variable transcription stability levels in the examined mRNAs as well as differences in expression between paralog gene copies. The 40s, b2m, ef1α and actb genes showed the most stable expression across all physiological conditions and tissues. The gapdh, odc1, and g6pd gene variants demonstrated lower stability. Differences in expression patterns between duplicated genes underline the possibility of functional divergence between them.

CD4+ T cells were isolated from murine spleen and activated with anti-CD3/-CD28 Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher, Langenselbold, Germany) on standard cell culture plates or in 3D scaffolds with or without compressive strain. Expression stability of nine potential reference genes was examined using four mathematical algorithms. Gene expression of Il2 was normalized to all potential reference genes to highlight the importance of correct normalization. Cell proliferation and the expression of the surface markers CD25 and CD69 were also determined. The 3D matrix did not inhibit proliferation after immunological activation of T cells and embedded the cells sufficiently to expose them to pressure load. Expression of ubiquitin C (Ubc) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) was the most stable under all conditions tested. A combination of these two genes was suitable for normalization of qPCR data. Normalization of Il2 gene expression showed highly variable results depending on the reference gene used.

To study the functional genes more effectively, it is essential to screen of reliable reference genes in the chicken liver, including females, males, embryos, as well as the Leghorn Male Hepatoma (LMH) cell line. Traditional reference gene screening involves selecting commonly used housekeeping genes (HKGs) for RT-qPCR experiments and using different algorithms to identify the most stable ones. However, this approach is limited in selecting the best reference gene from a small pool of HKGs. High-throughput sequencing technology may offer a solution to this limitation. This study aimed to identify the most consistently expressed genes by utilizing multiple published RNA-seq data of chicken liver and LMH cells. Subsequently, the stability of the newly identified reference genes was assessed in comparison to previously validated stable poultry liver expressed reference genes and the commonly employed HKGs using RT-qPCR. The findings indicated that there is a higher degree of similarity in stable expression genes between female and male liver (such as LSM14A and CDC40). In embryonic liver, the optimal new reference genes were SUDS3, TRIM33, and ERAL1. For LMH cells, the optimal new reference genes were ALDH9A1, UGGT1, and C21H1orf174. However, it is noteworthy that most HKGs did not exhibit stable expression across multiple samples, indicating potential instability under diverse conditions. Furthermore, RT-qPCR experiments proved that the stable expression genes identified from RNA-seq data outperformed commonly used HKGs and certain validated reference genes specific to poultry liver.

However, lack of prior knowledge on the optimal reference genes for RT-qPCR data normalization of A. ebracteatus, especially under stress scenarios, restricts gene expression investigations of this species. To address this issue, we evaluated the expression stability of seven candidate reference genes (ACT, PP2A, TUB, TUA, UBQ, EF-1α and RPS13) in leaves of A. ebracteatus upon heat, cadmium (Cd), drought, cold, flood and salt stress, respectively, using four state-of-the-art methods, GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder. The results indicated that ACT was the most stably expressed in most scenarios, while EF-1α, PP2A and TUB ranked first under Cd, flood and salt stress, respectively. TUB was also the suboptimal reference gene for the samples exposed to drought and cold stress, and ACT was the second-best for Cd stress. For all the examined stress conditions, a combination of two reference genes was considered to be adequate enough for accurate expression standardization. A functional gene FLA17 was further employed to validate the performance of the candidate reference genes. The expression profiles of FLA17 displayed similar trends when using the top two stable reference genes, but were under- or overestimated when normalized by less stable genes, indicative of the importance of choosing the optimal reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization.

However, rearing of octopus paralarvae is hampered by high mortality and poor growth rates that impede its entire culture. The study of genes involved in the octopus development and immune response capability could help to understand the key of paralarvae survival and thus, to complete the octopus life cycle.

To analyze raw cycle threshold values (Cp values) from qPCR run, three reference gene validation programs, including Bestkeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder, were used to evaluate the stability of ten candidate reference genes. The results showed that TATA-box binding protein (<i>TBP</i>) and tubulin beta 2a (<i>TUBB2a</i>) presented the highest stability for normalization under different treatments and were regarded as the most suitable reference genes of HepG2 and L02.

RT-qPCR is a widely used technique in gene expression studies. Proper normalisation is critical for accurate expression analysis. Currently, no validated reference genes are available for RT-qPCR in rat benign prostatic hyperplasia. Given that microRNAs regulate mRNA expression at the post-transcriptional level, they are usually studied together. Here, the expression stability of 21 putative reference genes including 8 mRNAs and 13 miRNAs was evaluated in benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats. Relative expression levels of each gene were detected in rats from a model group and a normal group using SYBR RT-qPCR. Expression stability was evaluated by geNorm and NormFinder. The commonly used reference genes, such as ACTB, B2M and mir-16, were less stable, and let-7a was eliminated due to a large C<sub>t</sub> value, most likely indicating a relatively low expression level.

Numerous genes are differentially expressed in skeletal muscles during muscle denervation and reinnervation following peripheral nerve injury. The identification of a suitable reference gene in innervated muscles following nerve injury may improve the understanding of the alterations in gene expression in the processes of peripheral nerve repair and regeneration. Therefore, in the present study, by using a rat sciatic nerve crush model, the expression levels of various housekeeping genes were examined.

In this study, our goal was to identify the most suitable housekeeping genes to perform comparable molecular analyses for DNA damage-related studies. Choosing the most applicable reference genes is important in any kind of target gene expression-related quantitative study, since using the housekeeping genes improperly may result in false data interpretation and inaccurate conclusions. We evaluated the expressional changes of eight well-known housekeeping genes (i.e., <i>18S rRNA</i>, <i>B2M</i>, <i>eEF1α1</i>, <i>GAPDH, GUSB</i>, <i>HPRT1</i>, <i>PPIA</i>, and <i>TBP</i>) following treatment with the DNA-damaging agents that are most frequently used: ultraviolet B (UVB) non-ionizing irradiation, neocarzinostatin (NCS), and actinomycin D (ActD). To reveal the significant changes in the expression of each gene and to determine which appear to be the most acceptable ones for normalization of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) data, comparative and statistical algorithms (such as absolute quantification, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, and independent samples T-test) were conducted. Our findings clearly demonstrate that the genes commonly employed as reference candidates exhibit substantial expression variability, and therefore, careful consideration must be taken when designing the experimental setup for an accurate and reproducible normalization of RT-qPCR data. We used the U2OS cell line since it is generally accepted and used in the field of DNA repair to study DNA damage-induced cellular responses. Based on our current data in U2OS cells, we suggest using <i>18S rRNA</i>, <i>eEF1α1</i>, <i>GAPDH</i>, <i>GUSB</i>, and <i>HPRT1</i> genes for UVB-induced DNA damage-related studies. <i>B2M</i>, <i>HPRT1</i>, and <i>TBP</i> genes are recommended for NCS treatment, while <i>18S rRNA</i>, <i>B2M</i>, and <i>PPIA</i> genes can be used as suitable internal controls in RT-qPCR experiments for ActD treatment.

Absolute quantification of viral RNA via reverse transcription, quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) necessitates the use of an appropriate RNA reference gene whose expression is unaffected by both experimental and confounding conditions. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of ribosomal protein S13 mRNA (RPS13) as a stable, medium abundance reference gene for RT-qPCR normalization of HIV/SIV RNA copy number. We developed a RPS13 RNA standard assay utilizing an in vitro RNA transcript for normalization of absolute SIV RNA quantities in tissues reservoirs. The RT-qPCR assay showed a high degree of repeatability and reproducibility across RNA levels appropriate for absolute SIV quantification. In assessing the utility of RPS13 as a reference gene, limited variation in the absolute, inter-tissue quantities of RPS13 mRNA was observed within multiple tissue samples obtained from rhesus macaques (average CV=2.86%). We demonstrate rhesus macaque RPS13 mRNA expression is not affected by alcohol administration, SIV infection, or antiviral therapy (PMPA/FTC).

The absence of efficient control management protocols, including a lack of resistant cultivars, has led to the development of different approaches to study this pathosystem. The production of resistant genotypes relies on D. citri gene expression analyses by RT-qPCR to assess control of the vector population. High-quality, reliable RT-qPCR analyses depend upon proper reference gene selection and validation. However, adequate D. citri reference genes have not yet been identified. In the present study, we evaluated the genes EF 1-α, ACT, GAPDH, RPL7, RPL17, and TUB as candidate reference genes for this insect.

Gene expression analysis of the conceptus and maternal reproductive tissues is a favourable method to assess the embryonic maternal interaction. The reliability of the commonly used method reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) depends on proper normalization to stable reference genes (RGs). The objective of this study was to determine the expression stability of 10 potential RGs in maternal reproductive tissues and foetal tissues, and to analyse the effect of RG selection on the calculation of the relative expression of target genes. The expression stability of 10 potential RGs was analysed in eight different tissues from three pregnant dairy cows. Three programs-GeNorm, NormFinder and Bestkeeper-were used to identify the best RGs. According to all three programs, the most stable RG was CNOT11, whereas the least stable RGs were GAPDH and HPRT1. GeNorm analysis showed that a combination of five RGs (SDHA, PPIA, CNOT11, RPS9 and RPL19) was necessary for appropriate data normalization. However, NormFinder analysis indicated that the combination of CNOT11 and PPIA was the most suitable.

They largely perform these roles through modulation of the expression of genes, especially those encoding cytokines. Murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) are commonly used as a model macrophage population for the study of immune responses to pro-inflammatory stimuli, notably lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which may be pertinent to the human situation. Evaluation of the temporal responses of LPS stimulated macrophages is widely conducted via the measurement of gene expression levels by RT-qPCR. While providing a robust and sensitive measure of gene expression levels, RT-qPCR relies on the normalisation of gene expression data to a stably expressed reference gene.

The study was designed to investigate why improved Aseel (PD4) is colorful, stronger, and grew slowly compared with the control broiler (CB). <b>Methods:</b> A microarray was conducted using the 7th-day embryo (7EB) and 18th-day thigh muscle (18TM) of improved Aseel and broiler, respectively. Also, we have selected 24 <i>Gallus gallus</i> candidate reference genes from NCBI, and total RNA was isolated from the broiler, improved Aseel embryo tissues, and their expression profiles were studied by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Furthermore, microarray data were validated with qPCR using improved Aseel and broiler embryo tissues. <b>Results:</b> In the differential transcripts screening, all the transcripts obtained by microarray of slow and fast growth groups were screened by fold change ≥ 1 and false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05. In total, 8,069 transcripts were differentially expressed between the 7EB and 18TM of PD4 compared to the CB. A further analysis showed that a high number of transcripts are differentially regulated in the 7EB of PD4 (6,896) and fewer transcripts are differentially regulated (1,173) in the 18TM of PD4 compared to the CB. On the 7th<sup>-</sup> and 18th-day PD4 embryos, 3,890, 3,006, 745, and 428 transcripts were up- and downregulated, respectively.

Furthermore, we validated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to muscle growth, myostatin signaling and development, and fatty acid metabolism genes in PD4 and CB embryo tissues by qPCR, and the results correlated with microarray expression data. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study identified DEGs that regulate the myostatin signaling and differentiation pathway; glycolysis and gluconeogenesis; fatty acid metabolism; Jak-STAT, mTOR, and TGF-β signaling pathways; tryptophan metabolism; and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways in PD4. The results revealed that the gene expression architecture is present in the improved Aseel exhibiting embryo growth that will help improve muscle development, differentiation, egg production, protein synthesis, and plumage formation in PD4 native chickens.

An important step in such an examination is normalization of the results by the application of appropriate internal control. In this study, we evaluated ten candidate reference genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum) to identify the most stable for normalization across different tissues and organs of developing plants. In Experiment 1, ten reference genes were analyzed in three tissues of the Ostka cultivar, with stability rankings generated using BestKeeper, NormFinder, geNorm, and RefFinder. Among these, Ta2776, eF1a, Cyclophilin, Ta3006, Ta14126, and Ref 2 were consistently identified as the most stable, while β-tubulin, CPD, and GAPDH were the least stable. In Experiment 2, six reference genes were tested across five tissues. Ta2776, Cyclophilin, Ta3006, and Ref 2 showed high stability across tissues, whereas CPD and Actin were less reliable. Analysis of the two best performing genes, Ref 2 and Ta3006, in twelve tissues/organs from two wheat cultivars, Kontesa and Ostka, revealed no significant differences in their expression between cultivars, confirming their suitability as reference genes for broader studies. Expression analysis of two target, developmentally expressed genes, TaIPT1 and TaIPT5, was conducted using absolute and normalized values. For TaIPT1, expressed in developing spikes, normalized and absolute values showed no significant differences. In contrast, for TaIPT5, expressed across all tested tissues, significant differences were observed between absolute and normalized values in most tissues. However, normalization using Ref 2, Ta3006, or both reference genes produced consistent results, underscoring the importance of proper reference gene selection.

29738567,Evaluation and selection of internal reference genes from two- and six-row U.S. malting barley varieties throughout micromalting for use in RT-qPCR.,"Walling Jason G, Zalapa Leslie A, Vinje Marcus A","Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a popular method for measuring transcript abundance. The most commonly used method of interpretation is relative quantification and thus necessitates the use of normalization controls (i.e. reference genes) to standardize transcript abundance. The most popular gene targets for RT-qPCR are housekeeping genes because they are thought to maintain a static transcript level among a variety of samples. However, more recent studies have shown, several housekeeping genes are not reliably stable. This is the first study to examine the potential of several reference genes for use in RT-qPCR normalization during barley malting. The process of malting barley mechanizes the imbibition and subsequent germination of barley seeds under controlled conditions. Malt quality is controlled by many pleiotropic genes that are determined by examining the result of physiological changes the barley seed undergoes during the malting process. We compared the stability of 13 reference genes across both two-and six-row malting barleys (Conrad and Legacy, respectfully) throughout the entirety of the malting process. Initially, primer target specificity, amplification efficiency and average Ct values were determined for each of the selected primer pairs. Three statistical programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to rank the stability of each reference gene. Rankings were similar between the two- and six-row with the exception of BestKeeper's ranking of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). A consensus ranking among programs was determined using RefFinder. Our results show that Actin (ACT) and Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) were the most stable throughout micromalting, while GAPDH and Cyclophilin (CYP) were the least stable.

36247637,Identification of stably expressed reference genes for expression studies in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> using mass spectrometry-based label-free quantification.,"Cheng Sau-Shan, Ku Yee-Shan, Cheung Ming-Yan, Lam Hon-Ming","<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> has been used regularly as a model plant in gene expression studies on transcriptional reprogramming upon pathogen infection, such as that by <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 (<i>Pst</i> DC3000), or when subjected to stress hormone treatments including jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has been extensively employed to quantitate these gene expression changes. However, the accuracy of the quantitation is largely dependent on the stability of the expressions of reference genes used for normalization. Recently, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been widely used to mine stably expressed genes for use as references in RT-qPCR. However, the amplification step in RNA-seq creates an intrinsic bias against those genes with relatively low expression levels, and therefore does not provide an accurate quantification of all expressed genes. In this study, we employed mass spectrometry-based label-free quantification (LFQ) in proteomic analyses to identify those proteins with abundances unaffected by <i>Pst</i> DC3000 infection. We verified, using RT-qPCR, that the levels of their corresponding mRNAs were also unaffected by <i>Pst</i> DC3000 infection. Compared to commonly used reference genes for expression studies in <i>A. thaliana</i> upon <i>Pst</i> DC3000 infection, the candidate reference genes reported in this study generally have a higher expression stability. In addition, using RT-qPCR, we verified that the mRNAs of the candidate reference genes were stably expressed upon stress hormone treatments including JA, SA, and ABA.

39490201,Development of two step reverse transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) for simultaneous identification of saliva and semen.,"Lee So Eun, Koh Un Na, Fakhr Rita, Lim Si-Keun","Determination of the type of body fluids is essential for crime scene reconstruction and for improving the reliability of expert testimonies. Messenger RNA (mRNA) analysis by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has been used in forensic genetics, particularly for body fluid identification. It is a relative quantification method that compares the Ct values of target and reference gene. Thus, the method is unsuitable for determining exact copy numbers of the target gene. To address this limitation, this study performed body fluid-specific mRNA analysis using two-step reverse transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR), which is capable of absolute quantification. We found that RT-ddPCR was accurate and sensitive enough to detect as little as 1.5 copies/μl of complementary DNA (cDNA), making it suitable for application using casework samples. It was also highly specific for body fluids, as non-specific amplification did not occur. In addition, saliva-semen mixtures with ratios ranging from 1:50 to 50:1 were successfully identified. When comparing the results of RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR, some samples were difficult to interpret because of the high Ct values of RT-qPCR. However, when the same samples were analyzed using RT-ddPCR, saliva and semen were distinctly identified.

MJD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the coding region of the ATXN3 gene. Previous findings indicate the potential of transcriptional alterations in blood of MJD patients as biomarkers of disease. Accurate quantification of gene expression levels by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) depends on data normalization, usually performed using reference genes. Because the expression level of routinely used housekeeping genes may vary in multiple biological and experimental conditions, reference gene controls should be validated in each specific experimental design. Here, we aimed to evaluate the expression behavior of five housekeeping genes previously reported as stably expressed in peripheral blood of patients from several disorders-peptidylprolyl isomerase B (PPIB), TNF receptor associated protein 1 (TRAP1), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 1 (DECR1), and folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS).

Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR is routine for measuring gene expression in VIGS studies, yet reference gene stability has not been adequately evaluated when using VIGS especially under biotic stress in cotton. Here, we employed several statistical methods (∆Ct, geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and weighted rank aggregation) to evaluate the stability of six candidate reference genes (GhACT7, GhPP2A1, GhUBQ7, GhUBQ14, GhTMN5, and GhTBL6) in wild-type and VIGS-infiltrated plants under cotton aphid herbivory stress over time in a fully factorial experiment. Ranked stability analyses overwhelmingly indicated that the frequently used reference genes GhUBQ7 and GhUBQ14 were the least stable whereas GhACT7 and GhPP2A1 were the most stable under VIGS and cotton aphid herbivory stress. Results were validated by comparing normalization methods of the phytosterol biosynthesis gene GhHYDRA1 in response to aphid herbivory. Normalization using GhACT7/GhPP2A1 revealed significant upregulation of GhHYDRA1 in aphid-infested plants. Conversely, normalization using GhUBQ7 reduced sensitivity to detect expression changes, highlighting the importance of stable reference gene selection for accurate expression normalization and interpretation.

In Chile, the freshwater silverside fish Basilichthys microlepidotus inhabits both polluted and nonpolluted areas, showing differential gene expression related to pollution. In this study, we infer the stability of six potential reference genes (tubulin alpha, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta-actin, 60S ribosomal protein L13, and 60S ribosomal protein L8) in the gills and liver of silverside individuals inhabiting polluted and nonpolluted areas. To validate the reference genes selected, the most and least stable reference genes were used to normalize two target transcripts, one for each organ. The RefFinder tool was used to analyze and identify the most stably expressed genes. The 60S ribosomal protein L8 gene was ranked as the most stable gene for both organs.

The strength of this method depends greatly on the endogenous controls used for normalization, which are lacking for the milkweed bug system. Here, to fill in this gap in our knowledge, we validated the stability of a set of ten candidate reference genes identified from the O. fasciatus transcriptome, and did so upon exposure to a dietary toxin, a cardiac glycoside, and across four different exposure periods. To increase robustness against gDNA contaminants, genome resources were used to design intron-bridging primers. A comprehensive stability validation by the Bestkeeper, Normfinder, geNorm and comparative ΔCt methods identified ef1a and tubulin as the most stable genes across treatments and time points, whereas 18S rRNA was the most unstable. However, accounting for the temporal scale indicated that time point confined normalizers might enable higher quantification accuracy for treatment comparison.

Understanding processes underlying luteal physiology is therefore necessary to increase reproductive efficiency in cattle. A common technique for investigating luteal physiology is reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), a valuable tool for quantifying gene expression. However, reference-gene-based RT-qPCR quantification methods require utilization of stably expressed genes to accurately assess mRNA expression. Historically, selection of reference genes in cattle has relied on subjective selection of a small pool of reference genes, many of which may have significant expression variation among different tissues or physiologic states. This is particularly concerning in dynamic tissues such as the CL, with its capacity for rapid physiologic changes during luteolysis, and likely in the less characterized period of CL maintenance during pregnancy. Thus, there is a clear need to identify reference genes well suited for the bovine CL over a wide range of physiological states. Whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing stands as an effective method to identify new reference genes by enabling the assessment of the expression profile of the entire pool of mRNA transcripts. We report the identification of 13 novel putative reference genes using RNA sequencing in the bovine CL throughout early pregnancy and luteolysis: RPL4, UQCRFS1, COX4I1, RPS4X, SSR3, CST3, ZNF266, CDC42, CD63, HIF1A, YWHAE, EIF3E, and PPIB. Independent RT-qPCR analyses were conducted confirming expression stability in another set of CL tissues from pregnancy and regression, with analyses performed for 3 groups of samples: (1) all samples, (2) samples from pregnancy alone, and (3) samples throughout the process of CL regression. Seven genes were found to be more stable in all states than 2 traditional reference genes (ACTB and GAPDH): RPS4X, COX4I1, PPIB, SSR3, RPL4, YWHAE, and CDC42. When CL tissues from pregnant animals alone were analyzed, CST3, HIF1A, and CD63 were also identified as more stable than ACTB and GAPDH. Identification of these new reference genes will aid in accurate normalization of RT-qPCR results, contributing to proper interpretation of gene expression relevant to luteal physiology.

29209038,A simple method to assess group difference in RT-qPCR reference gene selection using GeNorm: The case of the placental sex.,"St-Pierre Joey, Grégoire Jean-Charles, Vaillancourt Cathy","Normalization with proper reference genes is a crucial step in obtaining accurate mRNA expression levels in RT-qPCR experiments. GeNorm and NormFinder are two commonly used software packages that help in selecting the best reference genes, based on their expression stability. However, GeNorm does not take into account a group variable, such as sample sex, in its calculation. We demonstrate a simple calculation step to assess the variability of such parameters by multiplying the GeNorm M value with the difference of Cq values between groups. To test this, we used 28 reference gene candidates, to analyze 20 placental samples (10 of each sex), and by using HPRT1 (lower Cq values in male placentas (P = 0.017)), as a target gene. Our calculation demonstrates that the RPL30 - GAPDH reference gene combination is the better option to assess small placental sex differences in mRNA level, versus the selection obtained from GeNorm or NormFinder. The HPRT1 normalized mRNA expression level is different between placental sexes, using RPL30 and GAPDH as reference genes (P = 0.01), but not when using genes suggested by GeNorm or NormFinder.

It is still of ambiguous etiology. Gene expression studies of relevant target genes using reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) in SIDS cases, and comparing them with age-matched controls, could help in understanding the pathogenesis of SIDS. However, selecting inadequate reference genes used for normalization of the RT-qPCR gene expression data can give misleading results. The aim of the present study was to identify reference genes with the most stable expression in post-mortem brainstem samples of SIDS and control cases. Among the five candidate reference genes (GAPDH, GUSB, HMBS, SDHA, UBXN6) studied in both groups, SDHA and UBXN6 were identified as the most stable. To further demonstrate the importance of using validated genes for RT-qPCR data normalization, the expression of a potential gene of interest in SIDS, the RPS27A gene, was evaluated using validated versus non-validated reference genes for normalization. This gene encodes the ubiquitin protein that has been shown in other pathological studies to be induced in SIDS. Using the identified most stable genes for normalization of RPS27A gene expression data revealed, as expected, a statistically significant up-regulation in SIDS as compared to the controls. However, using a single unstable reference gene for normalization resulted in no significant differences in transcript abundance of RPS27A between SIDS and the controls.

Selection of suitable internal control gene(s) is essential to accurately assess gene expression levels. For the mangrove plant, Aegiceras corniculatum, reliable reference genes to normalize real-time quantitative PCR data have not been previously investigated. In this study, the expression stabilities of five candidate reference genes [glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 18SrRNA, β-Actin, 60S ribosomal protein L2, and elongation factor-1-A] were determined in leaves of A. corniculatum treated by cold, drought, salt, heavy metals, and pyrene and in different tissues of A. corniculatum under normal condition. Two software programs (geNorm and NormFinder) were employed to analyze and rank the tested genes. Results showed that GAPDH was the most suitable reference gene in A. corniculatum and the combination of two or three genes was recommended for greater accuracy. To assess the value of these tested genes as internal controls, the relative quantifications of CuZnSOD gene were also conducted. Results showed that the relative expression levels of CuZnSOD gene varied depending on the internal reference genes used, which highlights the importance of the choice of suitable internal controls in gene expression studies. Furthermore, the results also confirmed that GAPDH was a suitable reference gene for qPCR normalization in A. corniculatum under abiotic stresses.

To perform reliable miRNA expression analysis using quantitative PCR, adequate data normalization is essential to remove nonbiological, technical variations. Ideal reference genes should be biologically stable and reduce technical variability of miRNA expression analysis. Herein is a new strategy for the identification and evaluation of reference genes that can be applied for miRNA-based diagnostic tests without entailing excessive additional experiments. We analyzed the expression of 11 carefully selected candidate reference genes in different types of cervical specimens [ie, tissues, scrapes, and self-collected cervicovaginal specimens (self-samples)]. To identify the biologically most stable reference genes, three commonly used algorithms (GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were combined. Signal-to-noise ratios and P values between control and disease groups were calculated to validate the reduction in technical variability on expression analysis of two marker miRNAs. miR-423 was identified as a suitable reference gene for all sample types, to be used in combination with RNU24 in cervical tissues, RNU43 in scrapes, and miR-30b in self-samples. These findings demonstrate that the choice of reference genes may differ between different types of specimens, even when originating from the same anatomical source.

It is a unique approach to measure the absolute copy number of nucleic acid targets without the need of external standards. This study evaluated the applicability of ddPCR as a quantitative detection tool for the Spiroplasma citri, causal agent of citrus stubborn disease (CSD) in citrus. Two sets of primers, SP1, based on the spiral in housekeeping gene, and a multicopy prophage gene, SpV1 ORF1, were used to evaluate ddPCR in comparison with real time (quantitative) PCR (qPCR) for S. citri detection in citrus tissues. Standard curve analyses on tenfold dilution series showed that both ddPCR and qPCR exhibited good linearity and efficiency. However, ddPCR had a tenfold greater sensitivity than qPCR and accurately quantified up to one copy of spiralin gene. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that the ddPCR methodology was more robust for diagnosis of CSD and the area under the curve was significantly broader compared to qPCR. Field samples were used to validate ddPCR efficacy and demonstrated that it was equal or better than qPCR to detect S. citri infection in fruit columella due to a higher pathogen titer. The ddPCR assay detected both the S. citri spiralin and the SpV1 ORF1 targets quantitatively with high precision and accuracy compared to qPCR assay.

Its popularity is reflected in the remarkable number of publications reporting RT-qPCR data. Careful normalisation within RT-qPCR studies is imperative to ensure accurate quantification of mRNA levels. This is commonly achieved through the use of reference genes as an internal control to normalise the mRNA levels between different samples. The selection of appropriate reference genes can be a challenge as transcript levels vary with physiology, pathology and development, making the information within the transcriptome flexible and variable. In this study, we examined the variation in expression of a panel of nine candidate reference genes in HCT116 and HT29 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional cultures, as well as in normal and cancerous colon tissue. Using normfinder we identified the top three most stable genes for all conditions. Further to this we compared the change in expression of a selection of PKC coding genes when the data was normalised to one reference gene and three reference genes.

In this context, relative gene expression by RT-qPCR have been largely used, due to its rapidity, high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. Although, appropriate reference gene selection is crucial for accurate interpretation of results. In this study, five reference genes (GAPDH, G6PDH, YWHAZ, ACTB, and B2M) were tested for expression stability in abomasum (fundic and pyloric regions) and abomasal lymph nodes of Morada Nova sheep classified as resistant (n = 5) or susceptible (n = 5) to H. contortus infection in a flock of 151 animals. GAPDH combined with YWHAZ were selected as reference genes for abomasal fundic region and abomasal lymph nodes, whereas YWHAZ was the most stable gene for abomasal pyloric region. These genes presented the lowest intra- and inter-group variations and, consequently, highest stability. In contrast, expression of G6PDH was the least stable in all tissues. The impact of reference gene selection was demonstrated by relative quantification of a pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNFα) in abomasal fundic region. Significant differences in TNFα expression levels between resistant and susceptible groups were only observed when the most stable genes (GAPDH combined with YWHAZ) or GAPDH were used as reference genes, whereas no significant differences were observed when other tested reference genes were used.

In this study, stability of housekeeping genes commonly employed as reference genes in qPCR analyses with Mytilus galloprovincialis was explored under field conditions. Mussels were collected from farms in the Northwestern Adriatic Sea. The sampling strategy considered latitudinal gradients of environmental parameters (proxied by location), gender, and their interactions with seasonality. Analyses of gene stability were performed using different algorithms. BestKeeper and geNorm agreed that combination of the ribosomal genes 18S ribosomal RNA (18S) and 28S ribosomal RNA (28S) was the best normalization strategy in the conditions tested, which agrees with available evidence. NormFinder provided different normalization strategies, involving combinations of tubulin (TUB)/28S (Gender/Season effect) or TUB/helicase (HEL) (Location/Season effect). Since NormFinder considers data grouping and computes both intra- and inter-group stability variations, it should work better with complex experimental designs and dataset structuring.

However, suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR are often not available to investigate the expression of target genes in jellyfish under different conditions. To determine the responsible genes of jellyfish under hypoxia, primers to amplify the actin gene was designed for the amplification according to the conserved actin amino acid sequences of cnidarian. Then, we cloned and sequenced the partial cDNA sequence of β-actin gene containing 849 bp nucleic acids was cloned and sequenced, and the four common housekeeping genes (18S rRNA, β-actin, α-tubulin and GAPDH) were detected.

Due to its unique composition, in recent years an increasing interest in mare's milk consumption has been observed. Thus, investigating the genetic background of horse's milk variability presents and interesting study model. Relying on 39 milk samples collected from mares representing three breeds (Polish Primitive Horse, Polish Cold-blooded Horse, Polish Warmblood Horse) we aimed to investigate the utility of equine milk somatic cells as a source of mRNA and to screen the best reference genes for RT-qPCR using geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. The results showed that despite relatively low somatic cell counts in mare's milk, the amount and the quality of the extracted RNA are sufficient for gene expression studies. The analysis of the utility of 7 potential reference genes for RT-qPCR experiments for the normalization of equine milk somatic cells revealed some differences between the outcomes of the applied algorithms, although in both cases the KRT8 and TOP2B genes were pointed as the most stable. Analysis by geNorm showed that the combination of 4 reference genes (ACTB, GAPDH, TOP2B and KRT8) is required for apropriate RT-qPCR experiments normalization, whereas NormFinder algorithm pointed the combination of KRT8 and RPS9 genes as the most suitable.

Oridonin is one of the main active ingredients, and the route of its molecular biosynthesis remains to be determined. The study of gene expression patterns can provide clues toward the understanding of its biological functions. The selection of suitable reference genes for normalizing target gene expression is the first steps in any quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) gene expression study. Therefore, validation of suitable reference genes is necessary for obtaining reliable results in RT-qPCR analyses of I. rubescens. Here, 12 candidate reference genes were chosen, and their expression stability in different tissues of I. rubescens and in leaves under different abiotic stresses (NaCl, dehydration, SA, MeJA, and ABA) was evaluated using the ∆Ct, NormFinder, GeNorm, BestKeeper, and RankAggreg statistical tools.

28800817,Selection of reference genes to quantify relative expression of ochratoxin A-related genes by Penicillium nordicum in dry-cured ham.,"Bernáldez Victoria, Córdoba Juan J, Andrade María J, Alía Alberto, Rodríguez Alicia","Penicillium nordicum is an important and consistent producer of ochratoxin A (OTA) in NaCl-rich foods such as dry-cured ham. OTA is a toxic secondary metabolite which provokes negative effects on consumer health. Once OTA is produced in ham, this mycotoxin is difficult to remove. Since gene expression always precedes OTA production, analysis of expression of OTA-related genes by reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) could be a valuable tool to predict OTA contamination in ham. However scarce RT-qPCR protocols are properly validated leading to inconsistent data analyses. The objective of this study was to examine reference genes suitable for normalisation in designing and developing new RT-qPCR methods for quantifying the relative expression of genes involved in OTA biosynthesis (otapks and otanps) by P. nordicum on a dry-cured ham model system after 7 days of incubation. Firstly, primers based on three housekeeping genes commonly found in moulds, β-tubulin, COI and ITS, and on the otapks gene were designed. The primer pair F/R-npstr previously developed on the otanps gene was also used. Although most of the designed primers met the requirements needed to be used in qPCR assays, the primer pairs β-tubF1/R1, COI-F1/R1, ITSF2/R2 and otapksF3/R3 for the β-tubulin, COI, ITS and otapks genes, respectively, were selected due to their lowest C<sub>q</sub> value. Next, the two assumptions of the 2<sup>-ΔΔC</sup><sub>T</sub> method to evaluate the relative expression of the otapks and otanps genes were fulfilled for two of the three endogenous genes tested, β-tubulin and COI. However, β-tubulin was considered more proper as reference gene than COI under the environmental conditions assayed since its expression values by day 7 were more related to OTA production. Therefore, the two RT-qPCR methods for the analysis of the relative expression of the otapks and otanps genes have been properly validated and can be used as control tools to avoid or minimise the presence of OTA in ham.",Food microbiology,2017.0,England,10.1016/j.fm.2017.07.001,Journal Article,"Animals, Bacterial Proteins, Food Contamination, Meat Products, Ochratoxins, Penicillium, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards, Swine","Endogenous control, Otanps, Otapks, RT-qPCR, Relative expression","[reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), 2^-ΔΔCt method, β-tubulin, COI, ITS, otapks, otanps]","[Penicillium nordicum, Ochratoxin A, β-tubulin, COI, ITS, otapks, otanps]"

Although quantitative PCR (qPCR) is used to predict developmental potential, its reliability depends on the selection of appropriate reference genes (RGs) for normalization. To determine suitable RGs in bovine blastocysts with different developing speed, we evaluated the stability of eight candidate RGs (18S, ACTB, GAPDH, HMBS, PPIA, TBP, HPRT1, and SDHA) in early-, mid-, and late-developing IVF blastocysts (E-BL, M-BL, and L-BL, respectively) using RefFinder. Despite morphological similarities, E-BL, M-BL, and L-BL exhibited different biological features, including significantly lower pregnancy rates in L-BL than in the other groups, and less abundant transcript levels of five candidate RGs in L-BL than in E-BL.

To emphasize the critical importance of selecting stable RGs, we analyzed the expression of key developmental markers including those of the inner cell mass (ICM; OCT4, SOX2) and trophectoderm (TE; CDX2, GATA3, IFNτ), using various RGs for normalization. For ICM markers, normalization with ACTB showed results consistent with pregnancy rates, whereas moderately stable (18S) and less stable (TBP) RGs yielded contradictory outcomes. Normalization with unstable RGs produced inconsistent TE marker expression patterns (CDX2, GATA3) and overestimated (IFNτ) results across groups, compared with the results of ACTB.

This is especially true for root-knot nematodes (RKN, <i>Meloidogyne</i> spp.), whose drastic developmental changes are strongly dependent upon their environment. Here we utilized a publicly available <i>M. hapla</i> RNAseq database to identify putative HK genes throughout the nematode lifecycle. We then validated these candidate HK genes on <i>M. incognita</i> in order to develop a small library of suitable HK genes for RKN. Seven putative HK genes were selected for validation based on high expression level and ease of primer design. The expression of these genes was quantified by qPCR at different developmental stages to capture the entire life cycle of <i>M. incognita</i> which included eggs and naive infective juveniles through 3-wk post inoculation. Two algorithms, geNorm and Normfinder, identified three genes (<i>Disu</i>, <i>Poly</i>, and <i>Skinase</i>) constitutively and uniformly expressed throughout the entire life cycle of RKN. We believe these genes are superior HK genes suitable to be used as internal reference genes at all stages of RKN.

32437461,Selection and validation of reference genes for normalisation of gene expression in ischaemic and toxicological studies in kidney disease.,"Herath Sanjeeva, Dai Hongying, Erlich Jonathan, Au Amy Ym, Taylor Kylie, Succar Lena, Endre Zoltán H","Normalisation to standard reference gene(s) is essential for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to obtain reproducible and comparable results of a gene of interest (GOI) between subjects and under varying experimental conditions. There is limited evidence to support selection of the commonly used reference genes in rat ischaemic and toxicological kidney models. Employing these models, we determined the most stable reference genes by comparing 4 standard methods (NormFinder, qBase+, BestKeeper and comparative ΔCq) and developed a new 3-way linear mixed-effects model for evaluation of reference gene stability. This new technique utilises the intra-class correlation coefficient as the stability measure for multiple continuous and categorical covariates when determining the optimum normalisation factor. The model also determines confidence intervals for each candidate normalisation gene to facilitate selection and allow sample size calculation for designing experiments to identify reference genes. Of the 10 candidate reference genes tested, the geometric mean of polyadenylate-binding nuclear protein 1 (PABPN1) and beta-actin (ACTB) was the most stable reference combination. In contrast, commonly used ribosomal 18S and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were the most unstable. We compared the use of PABPN1×ACTB and 2 commonly used genes 18S and GAPDH on the expression of 4 genes of interest know to vary after renal injury and expressed by different kidney cell types (KIM-1, HIF1α, TGFβ1 and PECAM1). The less stable reference genes gave varying patterns of GOI expression in contrast to the use of the least unstable reference PABPN1×ACTB combination; this improved detection of differences in gene expression between experimental groups. Reduced within-group variation of the now more accurately normalised GOI may allow for reduced experimental group size particularly for comparison between various models.

Its use in aquaculture and study of fish physiology is increasing day by day. Relative quantification of mRNA through real-time qPCR requires suitable housekeeping genes/reference genes. Expression of housekeeping genes were thought to be constant in different tissues under various physiological and experimental conditions. In light of the literature reviewed here, it is clear that expression of most of the genes varied in different physiological conditions, under different experimental conditions, and in different gender. Use of housekeeping genes without proper validation may lead to erroneous results and misinterpretation of data. To solve this problem, various types of user-friendly software are now available for validation of housekeeping genes. Moreover, it is recommended to use more than one housekeeping gene for relative quantification. Using the geometric mean of the three most stable genes as a housekeeping gene can also solve this problem to some extent.

This situation is particularly relevant for the newborn population, where rapid development is associated with dynamic changes in gene expression. Real-time gene expression monitoring holds great promise for elucidating disrupted pathways that result in morbidities unique to this population, such as retinopathy of prematurity, but its impact depends on identifying stable and consistently expressed genes across a wide range of gestational ages. We extracted total RNA from 400 neonatal saliva samples (postconceptional ages: 32 5/7 to 48 2/7 weeks), converted it to cDNA, and pre-amplified and analyzed it by qPCR for three commonly used reference genes, ACTB, GAPDH, and YWHAZ. Relative quantification was determined using the Δ Ct method. Data were analyzed as a whole and also stratified by age and sex. Descriptive statistics and homogeneity of variance were performed to identify optimal reference genes. Data analyzed from all ages and both sexes showed significant expression variation for ACTB, while GAPDH and YWHAZ showed greater stability. Male infants exhibited increased expression variation compared to females for ACTB, but neither GAPDH nor YWHAZ showed significant variance for either sex. We suggest that ACTB is an unreliable reference gene for the newborn population. Males showed significantly more variation in ACTB expression compared to females, which suggests a sex-specific developmental role for this biomarker. By contrast, GAPDH and YWHAZ were less variable and therefore preferable for use in neonates.

In addition, a comprehensive analysis software (RefFinder) was used to assign an overall final rank for each candidate gene. The results showed that β-actin and β-TUB were the best two reference genes and were subjected to evaluate expression of two protective enzyme genes (EsCu/ZnSOD and EsCAT1) in E. sexmaculatus. We found that the expression of EsCu/ZnSOD and EsCAT1 in E. sexmaculatus feeding on mite-resistant rubber tree germplasm was significantly lower compared with those feeding on mite-susceptible germplasm.

Accurate qRT-PCR normalization requires the identification of stable reference genes under specific experimental conditions. Although seven reference genes have been used in Taraxacum kok-saghyz (TKS), an alternative natural rubber-producing crop, a systematic identification of reliable internal references for gene expression analysis across tissues at distinct developmental stages of TKS has not been conducted. In this study, we screened 12 candidate reference genes (CRGs) based on RNA-seq data from 26 TKS samples, representing five tissue types and nine developmental stages. The expression levels of the 12 CRGs, along with 7 previously reported reference genes (RRGs), were quantified by qRT-PCR across various tissues and developmental stages. The expression stability of the 19 genes was further evaluated by four commonly used algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, comparative delta Ct, and BestKeeper), and their results were integrated by RefFinder to generate a comprehensive stability ranking. The final results revealed that TkADF1 and TkRPT6A were the most suitable internal control genes for the all-tissue group and leaf samples. TkUPL and TkSIZ1 were found to be optimal for root samples, while TkADF1 and TkSRPRA were preferred choices for latex samples.

30699165,Identification of qPCR reference genes suitable for normalizing gene expression in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,"Hildyard John C W, Finch Amber M, Wells Dominic J","The mdx mouse is the most widely-used animal model of the human disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression in the muscles of this animal plays a key role in the study of pathogenesis and disease progression and in evaluation of potential therapeutic interventions. Normalization to appropriate stably-expressed reference genes is essential for accurate quantitative measurement, but determination of such genes is challenging: healthy and dystrophic muscles present very different transcriptional environments, further altering with disease progression and muscle use, raising the possibility that no single gene or combination of genes may be stable under all experimental comparative scenarios. Despite the pedigree of this animal model, this problem remains unaddressed. The aim of this work was therefore to comprehensively assess reference gene suitability in the muscles of healthy and dystrophic mice, identifying reference genes appropriate for specific experimental comparisons, and determining whether an essentially universally-applicable set of genes exists. Using a large sample collection comprising multiple muscles (including the tibialis anterior, diaphragm and heart muscles) taken from healthy and mdx mice at three disease-relevant ages, and a panel of sixteen candidate reference genes (FBXO38, FBXW2, MON2, ZFP91, HTATSF1, GAPDH, ACTB, 18S, CDC40, SDHA, RPL13a, CSNK2A2, AP3D1, PAK1IP1, B2M and HPRT1), we used the geNorm, BestKeeper and Normfinder algorithms to identify genes that were stable under multiple possible comparative scenarios. We reveal that no single gene is stable under all conditions, but a normalization factor derived from multiple genes (RPL13a, CSNK2A2, AP3D1 and the widely-used ACTB) appears suitable for normalizing gene expression in both healthy and dystrophic mouse muscle regardless of muscle type or animal age. We further show that other popular reference genes, including GAPDH, are markedly disease- or muscle-type correlated.

The most commonly used method for molecular studies of human BAT is the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). This method requires normalization to a reference gene (genes with uniform expression under different experimental conditions, e.g. similar expression levels between human BAT and WAT), but so far no evaluation of reference genes for human BAT has been performed. Two different microarray datasets with samples containing human BAT were used to search for genes with low variability in expression levels. Seven genes (FAM96B, GNB1, GNB2, HUWE1, PSMB2, RING1 and TPT1) identified by microarray analysis, and 8 commonly used reference genes (18S, B2M, GAPDH, LRP10, PPIA, RPLP0, UBC, and YWHAZ) were selected and further analyzed by quantitative PCR in both BAT containing perirenal adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Results were analyzed using 2 different algorithms (Normfinder and geNorm). Most of the commonly used reference genes displayed acceptably low variability (geNorm M-values <0.5) in the samples analyzed, but the novel reference genes identified by microarray displayed an even lower variability (M-values <0.25).

Busulfan-induced vascular endothelial injury is an important feature after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). But the molecular mechanism of how the injured ECs affect hematopoietic reconstruction is still unknown. It is possibly through modulation of the change of some gene expression. RT-qPCR is one of the most popular methods used to accurately determine gene expression levels, based on stable reference gene (RG) selection from housekeeping genes. So our aim is to select stable RGs for more accurate measures of mRNA levels during Busulfan-induced vascular endothelial injury. In this study, 14 RGs were selected to investigate their expression stability in ECs during 72 hours of EC injury treated with Busulfan. Our results revealed extreme variation in RG stability compared by five statistical algorithms. ywhaz and alas1 were recognized as the two idlest RGs on account of the final ranking, while the two most usually used RGs (gapdh and actb) were not the most stable RGs. Next, these data were verified by testing signalling pathway genes ctnnb1, robo4, and notch1 based on the above four genes ywha, alas1, gapdh, and actb. It shows that the normalization of mRNA expression data using unstable RGs greatly affects gene fold change, which means the reliability of the biological conclusions is questionable. Based on the best RGs used, we also found that robo4 is significantly overexpressed in Busulfan-impaired ECs. In conclusion, our data reaffirms the importance of RGs selection for the valid analysis of gene expression in Busulfan-impaired ECs.

Because of early cytokine production after physiologic stresses, the regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts can be used to assess immunologic responses before changes in protein production. To detect and assess early immune changes in endangered Florida manatees ( Trichechus manatus latirostris), we developed and validated a panel of quantitative PCR assays to measure mRNA transcription levels for the cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ; interleukin (IL)-2, -6, and -10; tumor necrosis factor-α; and the housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and β-actin (reference genes). Assays were successfully validated using blood samples from free-ranging, apparently healthy manatees from the east and west coasts of central Florida, US. No cytokine or housekeeping gene transcription levels were significantly different among age classes or sexes.

Reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) serves as a powerful tool to assess gene expression, however highly dependent on a reliable reference gene. Therefore, it is necessary to identify stable reference genes for gene expression study under MP or NP stress. We constructed a mouse model postexposure to polypropylene microplastics (PP-MPs) to assess PP-MPs bioaccumulation in kidney, evaluate the kidney pathological changes, and then explore potential reference genes via RT-qPCR. Although the hematoxylin-eosin staining showed no obvious damage in kidney tissues, we observed significant PP-MPs accumulation in kidney using Raman spectra analysis supported by spectral multivariate analysis. The expression of 19 candidate reference genes were examined, including the commonly used ones of β-actin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4I1 (Cox4i), Histocompatibility 13 (H13) and ribosomal protein.

Next, we transcribed mRNA from brain tissue after acute brain injury and naïve mice into cDNA for qPCR. Depending on tested genes, some kits failed to show linear results in dilution series and revealed strong variations in cDNA yield. Absolute expression data in naïve and trauma settings varied substantially between these kits. Normalization with a housekeeping gene failed to reduce kit-dependent variations, whereas normalization eliminated differences when naïve samples from the same region were used. The study shows strong evidence that choice of commercial cDNA synthesis kit has a major impact on PCR results and, consequently, on comparability between studies.

However, variants in the reference amplicon may cause errors, which was investigated herein. While conducting copy number variation validations for birth defects research studies, 13 of 1634 specimens with multiple loci that appeared to be present as three copies were unexpectedly detected. This apparent trisomy was hypothesized to be an amplification artifact caused by a variant in the RPPH1 amplicon. Sequencing revealed all 13 individuals carried one of the four different variants within the RPPH1 amplicon. These variants could produce allelic dropout or altered reaction efficiency, causing an inaccurate measurement of copy number. Additional genotyping predicted a low frequency of the most common variant (rs3093876; 14/3562 alleles; minor allele frequency, 0.39%). Laboratories should recognize the potential for inaccurate results when using a single qPCR control assay. Overestimated CFTR and SMN2 copy numbers identified during newborn screening that otherwise would have been incorrectly called were also detected. Variants in reference loci may produce false-negative normal results for test loci when real deletions are present.

Therefore, it is crucial to have suitable reference genes (RGs) for result normalization. Although several reports describe UV-B-modulated gene expression in Solanum lycopersicum, there are no suitable RGs identified until now. The aim of this work was to evaluate the suitability of seven traditional genes: actin (ACT), tubulin (TUB), ubiquitin (UBI), glyceraldehyde- 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), elongation factor 1α (EF1α), phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2A) and GAGA binding transcriptional activator (GAGA); and two non-traditional genes: thioredoxin h1 (TRX h1) and UV-B RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8), as candidate RGs for their potential use as reliable internal controls in leaves, stems and roots of tomato seedlings exposed to acute and chronic UV-B. The stability of these genes expression was evaluated using five statistical algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, Delta Ct and ANOVA. Considering the comprehensive stability ranking, we recommend ACT+TUB as the best pair of RGs for leaves, PP2A+GAPDH+TRX h1 for stems and TUB+UVR8 for roots. The reliability of the selected RGs for each tissue was verified amplifying tomato chalcone synthase 1 (CHS1) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyase (PHR1-LIKE). Under UV-B treatment, CHS1 was upregulated in leaves, stems and roots whereas PHR1-LIKE was only upregulated in leaves and stems.

The most common cause of SCD is coronary artery disease related to coronary atherosclerosis. Previous study suggested the possible application of connexin 43 (Cx43) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO1) immunostaining in the early diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. However, there appears to be insufficient data with regard to their mRNA levels. The present study investigated the cardiac mRNA levels of Cx43 and ZO1, using forensic autopsy materials consisting of 41 control cases without any disease or structural abnormality of the heart (group 1), 32 deaths due to acute ischemic heart disease related to coronary atherosclerosis without apparent myocardial necrosis (group 2), and 29 traumatic deaths with coronary atherosclerosis (group 3).

Relative mRNA quantification demonstrated decreased calibrated normalized relative quantity (CNRQ) values of Cx43 and ZO1 in bilateral ventricles of group 2. When using one conventional reference gene (GAPDH or ACTB) for normalization, nearly no difference was detected among the three groups.

Since site-specific insertion of the mobile ClosTron insert may cause errors, validation is key. In this paper we describe the use of digital PCR (dPCR) as an alternative tool in selecting clostridial mutant strains. Clostridium perfringens chitinase mutant strains were constructed in which the mobile ClosTron intron was inserted into one of the chitinase genes. On-target insertion of the mobile intron was validated through conventional PCR. In order to confirm the absence of off-target insertions, dPCR was used to determine the amount of the ClosTron intron as well as the amount of a reference gene, located in close proximity to the interrupted gene. Subsequently, mutant strains containing an equivalent amount of both genes were selected as these do not contain additional off-target mobile ClosTron inserts. The outcome of this selection procedure was confirmed through a validated PCR-based approach. In addition to its application in mutant selection, dPCR can be used in other aspects of clostridial research, such as the distinction and easy quantification of different types of strains (wildtype vs. mutant) in complex matrices, such as faecal samples, a process in which other techniques are hampered by bacterial overgrowth (plating) or inhibition by matrix contaminants (qPCR). This research demonstrates that dPCR is indeed a high-throughput method in the selection of clostridial insertion mutants as well as a robust and accurate tool in distinguishing between wildtype and mutant C. perfringens strains, even in a complex matrix such as faeces.

With the use of transcriptome data generated from poplar/canker disease interaction system, we describe a methodology to identify candidate reference genes from high-throughput sequencing data. This methodology will improve the accuracy of RT-qPCR and will lead to better standards for the normalization of expression data. Expression stability analysis from xylem and phloem of <i>Populus bejingensis</i> inoculated with the fungal canker pathogen <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i> revealed that 729 poplar transcripts (1.11%) were stably expressed, at a threshold level of coefficient of variance (CV) of FPKM < 20% and maximum fold change (MFC) of FPKM < 2.0. Expression stability and bioinformatics analysis suggested that commonly used house-keeping (HK) genes were not the most appropriate internal controls: 70 of the 72 commonly used HK genes were not stably expressed, 45 of the 72 produced multiple isoform transcripts, and some of their reported primers produced unspecific amplicons in PCR amplification. RT-qPCR analysis to compare and evaluate the expression stability of 10 commonly used poplar HK genes and 20 of the 729 newly-identified stably expressed transcripts showed that some of the newly-identified genes (such as SSU_S8e, LSU_L5e, and 20S_PSU) had higher stability ranking than most of commonly used HK genes.

27232341,Normalization of qPCR in platelets - YWHAE a potential genericreference gene.,"Mossberg Karin, Svensson Per-Arne, Gidlöf Olof, Erlinge David, Jern Sverker, Brogren Helén","The mRNA of human platelets has been extensively studied and it is generally appreciated that platelets contain mRNA transcripts derived from the megakaryocytes, and they have the ability to translate it into proteins. Additionally, platelets contain microRNA (miRNA) that has been shown to potentially regulate the translation of certain proteins. When quantifying gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), a valid normalization method is required and the use of reference genes is a common and robust approach. It is recommended to perform a proper validation of potential reference genes for each individual experimental setup. Previous studies have mainly been performed using commonly used reference genes for nucleated cells, and to our knowledge there are no global evaluations of the stability of transcripts in platelets. Finding a stable transcript would be valuable for inter-study comparisons, and the aim of this study was to identify one or more stable mRNA transcripts suitable as generic reference genes for mRNA gene expression studies in platelets. Platelets were incubated for 24 h and microarray of platelet mRNA revealed that the levels of YWHAE, B2M, ITM2B, H3F3A, PF4V1 remained similar between 0 and 24 h. Further validation of the stability of these genes together with GAPDH, RN18S1, and PPIA, genes frequently used as reference genes in platelet studies, was performed using qPCR after different in vitro conditions. In addition, inter-individual stability of the genes was analyzed in diabetic patients compared with healthy matched controls. Analysis of gene stability by the software RefFinder revealed that YWHAE, PF4V1, and B2M were the most stable genes in platelets from healthy donors. In addition, YWHAE was stable between subjects. Furthermore, the potential influence of miRNA on the selected genes was investigated by knockdown of Dicer1 in the megakaryocytic cell line MEG01. YWHAE, H3F3A, B2M, and GAPDH remained unchanged over time in MEG01 cells indicating that these genes are not regulated by miRNA and hence are more stably expressed. In conclusion, YWHAE is a stable transcript in platelets and we suggest the use of YWHAE as a generic reference gene in mRNA gene expression studies.",Platelets,2016.0,England,10.1080/09537104.2016.1180349,Journal Article,"14-3-3 Proteins, Biomarkers, Blood Platelets, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Gene Expression, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, MicroRNAs, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reproducibility of Results","mRNA, miRNA, normalization, platelets, qPCR, reference genes","[microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), RefFinder, YWHAE, B2M, ITM2B, H3F3A, PF4V1, GAPDH, RN18S1, PPIA, megakaryocytic cell line MEG01, Dicer1 knockdown]","[YWHAE, B2M, ITM2B, H3F3A, PF4V1, GAPDH, RN18S1, PPIA]

In this study, the gene expression profiles of 9 major tissues of Lueyang black-bone chicken were successfully constructed by transcriptome sequencing technology. Through in-depth analysis of transcriptome data, a total of 10 housekeeping genes (HKGs) and 87 marker genes (MGs) were identified. Furthermore, by applying weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we delineated nine tissue-specific modules and 90 hub genes, offering novel insights into the regulatory networks underlying tissue-specific gene expression. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that HKGs were predominantly involved in maintaining fundamental cellular functions, with significant enrichment in pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation, cell cycle regulation, and DNA replication. MGs were closely associated with tissue-specific physiological functions, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms governing tissue functionality. Notably, through multidimensional validation, EEF1A1 and FTH1 were confirmed to exhibit cross-tissue expression stability, establishing them as ideal reference genes for multi-tissue qPCR experiments in chickens. Additionally, we successfully identified tissue marker genes, including TNNT2, PIT54, SFTPC, and PGM1, which are specific to the heart, liver, lung, and breast muscle, respectively.

29543906,Identifying optimal reference genes for the normalization of microRNA expression in cucumber under viral stress.,"Liang Chaoqiong, Hao Jianjun, Meng Yan, Luo Laixin, Li Jianqiang","Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) is an economically important pathogen and causes significant reduction of both yield and quality of cucumber (Cucumis sativus). Currently, there were no satisfied strategies for controlling the disease. A better understanding of microRNA (miRNA) expression related to the regulation of plant-virus interactions and virus resistance would be of great assistance when developing control strategies for CGMMV. However, accurate expression analysis is highly dependent on robust and reliable reference gene used as an internal control for normalization of miRNA expression. Most commonly used reference genes involved in CGMMV-infected cucumber are not universally expressed depending on tissue types and stages of plant development. It is therefore crucial to identify suitable reference genes in investigating the role of miRNA expression. In this study, seven reference genes, including Actin, Tubulin, EF-1α, 18S rRNA, Ubiquitin, GAPDH and Cyclophilin, were evaluated for the most accurate results in analyses using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gene expression was assayed on cucumber leaves, stems and roots that were collected at different days post inoculation with CGMMV. The expression data were analyzed using algorithms including delta-Ct, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper as well as the comparative tool RefFinder. The reference genes were subsequently validated using miR159.

To quantitatively analyze P. aeruginosa's gene expression and assess factors affecting it, reference genes stably expressed under varying concentrations of n-hexadecane stress need to be identified. In this study, we used P. aeruginosa L10 as the test strain and identified eight candidate reference genes: rpsL, nadB, clpX, anr, rpoS, gyrA, tipA, and recA. The cultures were cultured under different concentrations of n-hexadecane (the concentrations were 0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%,), and then the gene expression was detected by quantitative Real-time PCR, that is, the changes of Ct values.

Normfinder calculates gene stability values taking into account within- and between-group variation in gene expression. BestKeeper evaluates the stability of individual genes through correlation analysis. RefFinder provides a comprehensive assessment of reference gene stability by integrating four methods. The results indicated that among the reference genes of P. aeruginosa L10 cultured under various concentrations of n-hexadecane stress, anr had the highest Ct value and expression abundance, while tipA had the lowest.

Significant economic interests have led to the development of a plurality of assays, available for almost any genotyping platform or DNA detection chemistry. Of all the genetic variants, copy number variations are particular difficult to detect by polymerase chain reaction. Here, we present two simple novel approaches for the identification of samples carrying either deletions or duplications of the <i>CYP2D6</i> gene; by relative quantification using a singleplex 5'nuclease real-time PCR assay, and by high-resolution melting of PCR products. These methods make use of universal primers, targeting both the <i>CYP2D6</i> and the reference gene <i>CYP2D8P</i>, which is necessary for the analysis. The assays were validated against a reference method using a large set of samples. The singleplex nature of the 5'nuclease real-time PCR ensures that the primers anneal with equal affinity to both the sequence of the <i>CYP2D6</i> and the reference gene. This facilitates robust identification of gene deletions and duplications based on the cycle threshold value.

Among various detecting techniques, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is a sensitive and efficient tool. Stable reference genes are critical for relative qPCR analysis. However, accumulated evidence shows that conventional reference genes can vary significantly under different experimental setups. Here we evaluated the stability of eight candidate reference genes of zebrafish with or without exposure to different concentrations of Cd. The results showed that the best four suitable reference genes in the five selected organs were: (1) spleen: β-actin>gapdh>ef1α>rpl13α; (2) kidney: rplp2>rpl7>β-actin>ef1α; (3) liver: rpl7>rpl13α>β-actin>ef1α; (4) gills: rplp2>gapdh>rnf7>ef1α; (5) intestine: ef1α>rnf7>rplp2>rpl13α.

One of the key considerations when conducting gene expression analyses using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the selection of appropriate reference genes, which is often overlooked. Specifically, to reach meaningful conclusions when using relative quantification approaches, expression levels of reference genes must be highly stable and cannot vary as a function of experimental conditions. However, to date, information on the stability of commonly used reference genes across developmental stages, tissues and after exposure to contaminants such as metals is lacking for many vertebrate species including teleost fish. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the stability of expression of 8 reference gene candidates in the gills and skin of three different early life-stages of rainbow trout after acute exposure (24h) to two metals, cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) using qPCR. Candidate housekeeping genes were: beta actin (b-actin), DNA directed RNA polymerase II subunit I (DRP2), elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1a), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), ribosomal protein L8 (RPL8), and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S). Four algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative ΔCt method were employed to systematically evaluate the expression stability of these candidate genes under control and exposed conditions as well as across three different life-stages. Finally, stability of genes was ranked by taking geometric means of the ranks established by the different methods. Stability of reference genes was ranked in the following order (from lower to higher stability): HPRT<GAPDH<EF1a<G6PD<RPL8<DRP2<b-actin in gills of fish exposed to Cd; b-actin<GAPDH<G6PD<DRP2<RPL8<HPRT<EF1a in gills of fish exposed to Cu; RPL8<HPRT<GAPDH<G6PD<EF1a<DRP2<b-actin in the skin of fish exposed to Cd; and EF1a<GAPDH<RPL8<HPRT<G6PD<b-actin<DRP2 in the skin of fish exposed to Cu.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a technique that rapidly and accurately determines gene expression changes. It is crucial, however, that stable reference genes are selected for each experimental condition to ensure that accurate values are obtained for genes of interest.

This is the first study to systematically evaluate reference genes in male Sprague-Dawley rat models of epilepsy. We assessed 15 potential reference genes in hippocampal tissue obtained from 2 different models during epileptogenesis, 1 model during chronic epilepsy, and a model of noninjurious seizures. Reference gene ranking varied between models and also differed between epileptogenesis and chronic epilepsy time points. There was also some variance between the four mathematical models used to rank reference genes. Notably, we found novel reference genes to be more stably expressed than those most often used in experimental epilepsy studies.

This parasite is usually found as a motile flagellated trophozoite. However, when subjected to stressful microenvironmental conditions, T. vaginalis trophozoites can differentiate into peculiar cyst-like stages, which exhibit notable physiological resistance to unfavourable conditions. Although well documented in morphological and proteomic terms, patterns of gene expression changes involved in the cellular differentiation into cyst-like stages are mostly unknown. The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is recognized as a sensitive and accurate method for quantification of gene expression, providing fluorescence-based data that are proportional to the amount of a target RNA.

The genotypic differentiation of Medaka sex allows diagnosing the sex reversal, and is required in current test guidelines (e.g. OECD TG 240, 2015). DNA isolation for genetic sex-identification requires sample collection, which has been normally conducted using invasive (fish sacrifice) or semi-invasive (fin-clip) procedures, which conflicts with the need for a fast, simple, and stress-free method. Swabbing skin mucus to collect DNA has been adopted in ecological studies of larger fish, however for smaller fish, it has to be established. To handle larger number of samples, real-time PCR represents a faster and sensitive method compared to conventional PCR.

Our study evaluates the macroscopic changes and efficiency of DNA profiling in burnt teeth under controlled temperature and time conditions. 28 teeth were exposed to temperatures between 100 and 700°C for a duration of 1-15min. Two non-burnt teeth were used as control. Macroscopic changes were evaluated and recorded. DNA was extracted using a silica-based methodology. Efficiency of DNA profiling was assessed through Quantitative PCR for STRs. Burnt teeth reached chalky white appearance at 400°C 5min and fractures were observed from 300°C 10min. Amplification of STRs was very low from 300°C and 1 or 5min. In contrast, the housekeeping gene, GAPDH, was amplified in all combinations of temperatures and times. Although it is possible to amplify the housekeeping gene at high temperature, DNA profiling is difficult to obtain, probably due to small size of these regions making them more prone to degradation.",Science & justice : journal of the Forensic Science Society,2016.0,England,10.1016/j.scijus.2016.06.006,Journal Article,"Adult, Aged, DNA, DNA Fingerprinting, Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (Phosphorylating), Hot Temperature, Humans, Microsatellite Repeats, Middle Aged, Molar, Third, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Young Adult","Burnt teeth, DNA isolation, Forensic odontology, Housekeeping genes, Macroscopic changes, STR profiling","[silica-based methodology, Quantitative PCR, STRs]",[Human teeth]

A critical, yet often underappreciated, problem when analysing qRT-PCR data is the selection of suitable reference genes. This problem is compounded in situations where up to 25% of all genes may change (e.g., due to leukocyte invasion), as is typically the case in ARDS. Here, we examined 11 widely used reference genes for their suitability in commonly used models of acute lung injury (ALI): ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), in vivo and ex vivo, lipopolysaccharide plus mechanical ventilation (MV), and hydrochloric acid plus MV. The stability of reference gene expression was determined using the NormFinder, BestKeeper, and geNorm algorithms. We then proceeded with the geNorm results because this is the only algorithm that provides the number of reference genes required to achieve normalisation. We chose interleukin-6 (<i>Il-6</i>) and C-X-C motif ligand 1 (<i>Cxcl-1</i>) as the genes of interest to analyse and demonstrate the impact of inappropriate normalisation. Reference gene stability differed between the ALI models and even within the subgroup of VILI models, no common reference gene index (RGI) could be determined. NormFinder, BestKeeper, and geNorm produced slightly different, but comparable results. Inappropriate normalisation of <i>Il-6</i> and <i>Cxcl1</i> gene expression resulted in significant misinterpretation in all four ALI settings.

Nonetheless, verification of expression of reference genes in selected studied tissue is essential in order to accurately assess the level of expression of target genes of interest. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to examine six commonly used reference genes in order to identify the gene being expressed most constantly under the influence of testosterone in the kidneys and hypothalamus. The reference genes include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), actin beta (ACTB), beta-2 microglobulin (B2m), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT), peptidylprolylisomerase A (Ppia) and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (Hmbs). The cycle threshold (Ct) value for each gene was determined and data obtained were analyzed using the software programs NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, and rank aggregation. Results showed that Hmbs and Ppia genes were the most stably expressed in the hypothalamus. Meanwhile, in kidneys, Hmbs and GAPDH appeared to be the most constant genes.

31335863,Optimal use of statistical methods to validate reference gene stability in longitudinal studies.,"Sundaram Venkat Krishnan, Sampathkumar Nirmal Kumar, Massaad Charbel, Grenier Julien","Multiple statistical approaches have been proposed to validate reference genes in qPCR assays. However, conflicting results from these statistical methods pose a major hurdle in the choice of the best reference genes. Recent studies have proposed the use of at least three different methods but there is no consensus on how to interpret conflicting results. Researchers resort to averaging the stability ranks assessed by different approaches or attributing a weighted rank to candidate genes. However, we report here that the suitability of these validation methods can be influenced by the experimental setting. Therefore, averaging the ranks can lead to suboptimal assessment of stable reference genes if the method used is not suitable for analysis. As the respective approaches of these statistical methods are different, a clear understanding of the fundamental assumptions and the parameters that influence the calculation of reference gene stability is necessary. In this study, the stability of 10 candidate reference genes (Actb, Gapdh, Tbp, Sdha, Pgk1, Ppia, Rpl13a, Hsp60, Mrpl10, Rps26) was assessed using four common statistical approaches (GeNorm, NormFinder, Coefficient of Variation or CV analysis and Pairwise ΔCt method) in a longitudinal experimental setting. We used the development of the cerebellum and the spinal cord of mice as a model to assess the suitability of these statistical methods for reference gene validation. GeNorm and the Pairwise ΔCt were found to be ill suited due to a fundamental assumption in their stability calculations. Highly correlated genes were given better stability ranks despite significant overall variation. NormFinder fares better but the presence of highly variable genes influences the ranking of all genes because of the algorithm's construct. CV analysis estimates overall variation, but it fails to consider variation across groups. We thus highlight the assumptions and potential pitfalls of each method using our longitudinal data. Based on our results, we have devised a workflow combining NormFinder, CV analysis along with visual representation of mRNA fold changes and one-way ANOVA for validating reference genes in longitudinal studies.

Primer-template mismatches may lead to underestimation of the input sample quantity due to inefficient annealing and amplification. But how primer-template mismatches affect quantification accuracy has not been rigorously investigated. In this study, we performed a series of qPCR experiments in which we tested three pairs of mismatched telomere primers (tel1/tel2, tel1b/tel2b and telg/telc) and two pairs of perfect-match reference gene primers (36B4-F/-R and IFNB1-F/-R) at three different primer concentrations under four cycling conditions. Templates used were genomic DNA from two human cell lines and oligo duplexes which contained telomere sequences, reference gene sequences, or both. We demonstrated that the underestimation of input sample quantity from reactions containing mismatched primers was not due to lower amplification efficiency (E), but due to ineffective usage of the input sample. We defined a novel concept of amplification efficacy (f) which quantifies the effectiveness of input sample amplification by primers. We have modified the conventional qPCR kinetic formula to include f, which corrects the effects of primer mismatches. We demonstrated that reactions containing mismatched telomere primer pairs had similar efficiency (E), but varying degrees of reduced efficacy (f) in comparison to those with the perfect-match gene primer pairs. Using the quantitative parameter f, underestimation of initial target by telomere primers can be adjusted to provide a more accurate measurement. Additionally, we found that the tel1b/tel2b primer set at concentration of 500 nM and 900 nM exhibited the best amplification efficacy f. This study provides a novel way to incorporate an evaluation of amplification efficacy into qPCR analysis.

Sheep are important for the study of human bone diseases, particularly for temporomandibular diseases. The present study aimed to identify a set of reference genes suitable for the normalization of qPCR data from the mandibular condyle of sheep. A total of 12 reference genes belonging to various functional classes were selected, and the expression stability of the reference genes was determined in both the normal and fractured area of the sheep mandibular condyle. RefFinder, which integrates the following currently available computational algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative ΔCt method, was used to compare and rank the candidate reference genes. The results obtained from the four methods demonstrated a similar trend: RPL19, ACTB, and PGK1 were the most stably expressed reference genes in the sheep mandibular condyle. As determined by RefFinder comprehensive analysis, the results of the present study suggested that RPL19 is the most suitable reference gene for studies associated with the sheep mandibular condyle.

The accurate assessment of changes in gene expression depends on the selection of adequate internal reference gene(s). Carbon monoxide (CO) affects several metabolic pathways and de novo protein synthesis is crucial in the cellular responses to this gasotransmitter. Herein a selection of commonly used reference genes was analyzed to identify the most suitable internal control genes to evaluate the effect of CO on gene expression in cultured cerebrocortical astrocytes. The cells were exposed to CO by treatment with CORM-A1 (CO releasing molecule A1) and four different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, Delta Ct and BestKeeper) were applied to evaluate the stability of eight putative reference genes. Our results indicate that Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) together with Ppia (peptidylpropyl isomerase A) is the most suitable gene pair for normalization of qRT-PCR results under the experimental conditions used. Pgk1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1), Hprt1 (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase I), Sdha (Succinate Dehydrogenase Complex, Subunit A), Tbp (TATA box binding protein), Actg1 (actin gamma 1) and Rn18s (18S rRNA) genes presented less stable expression profiles in cultured cortical astrocytes exposed to CORM-A1 for up to 60 min. For validation, we analyzed the effect of CO on the expression of Bdnf and bcl-2. Different results were obtained, depending on the reference genes used. A significant increase in the expression of both genes was found when the results were normalized with Gapdh and Ppia, in contrast with the results obtained when the other genes were used as reference.

The qPCR assays were validated by using both microbial isolates and clinical amniotic fluid samples. The assays were further validated by comparing qPCR amplification results to those from the microbial culture and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of amniotic fluid. Both assays demonstrated high reproducibility and are sensitive and specific to their intended targets.

Different studies have shown the validity of reference genes to vary greatly depending on tissue, cell subsets and experimental context. This study aimed at the identification of suitable reference genes for qPCR studies using different peripheral blood cell subsets (whole blood (WB) cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and PBMC subsets (CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, NK cells, monocytes, B cells and dendritic cells) from healthy controls (HC), patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and interferon-β-treated patients with RRMS (RRMS-IFN-β). Eight candidate reference genes (CASC3, EEF1A1, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPLP0, UBC, UBE2D2 and YWHAZ) were analysed using normfinder and genorm algorithms to identify the most stably expressed genes. We found reference gene expression varied most across cell subsets, and less variation between the donor groups. UBE2D2 was the most stably expressed gene across both HC and RRMS patients and across cell subsets, while UBC was the most stably expressed gene between HC, RRMS and RRMS-IFN-β patients. UBE2D2 and HPRT1 was the most stable combination for analyses of cell subsets between HC and RRMS patients, while the combination of UBC and YWHAZ was superior for analysis of cell subsets between HC, RRMS and RRMS-IFN-β groups.

To obtain reliable data on mRNA amounts and the estimation of gene expression levels, it is crucial to normalize the target gene with one or more internal reference gene(s). However, the use of constitutive genes as reference genes is controversial, as their expression patterns are sometimes more complex than previously thought. In various arthropod vectors, including ticks, several constitutive genes have been identified by studying gene expression in different tissues and life stages. The cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus is a major vector for several pathogens and is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions globally. Tick developmental physiology is an essential aspect of research, particularly embryogenesis, where many important developmental events occur, thus the identification of stable reference genes is essential for the interpretation of reliable gene expression data. This study aimed to identify and select R. microplus housekeeping genes and evaluate their stability during embryogenesis. Reference genes used as internal control in molecular assays were selected based on previous studies. These genes were screened by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and tested for gene expression stability during embryogenesis. Results demonstrated that the relative stability of reference genes varied at different time points during the embryogenesis. The GeNorm tool showed that elongation factor 1α (Elf1a) and ribosomal protein L4 (Rpl4) were the most stable genes, while H3 histone family 3A (Hist3A) and ribosomal protein S18 (RpS18) were the least stable. The NormFinder tool showed that Rpl4 was the most stable gene, while the ranking of Elf1a was intermediate in all tested conditions. The BestKeeper tool showed that Rpl4 and cyclophilin A (CycA) were the more and less stable genes, respectively. These data collectively demonstrate that Rpl4, Elf1a, and GAPDH are suitable internal controls for normalizing qPCR during R. microplus embryogenesis.

However, no reliable reference genes have been investigated for normalizing gene expression for this species. In this study, 12 candidate reference genes were selected to identify their stability under five different abiotic stress treatments (drought, salt, cadmium, chromium and arsenic) by using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder softwares. The results showed that 18S rRNA and Unigene33312 were the best reference genes under drought treatments. Unigene33312 and Unigene33024 were found to be the most stably expressed genes under salt stress and Cd stress. Moreover, Unigene33024 and PP2A were the most suitable reference genes under Cr stress and Unigene33024 and Sb09g019750 were deemed more suitable reference genes under As stress.

Selecting the correct reference gene to normalize the results is a key step in this method. Inaccurate data can be generated if the correct reference gene is not selected.

A comparative analysis of the expression stability of the selected genes was then performed with the genes that are most commonly used in the literature, i.e. β-actin and GAPDH.

The housekeeping genes were analyzed from healthy fish and in CyHV-2 challenged fish. Based upon the real time PCR results the gene expression varied among the genes and in tissues. The expression levels of the housekeeping genes were then compared and evaluated with the RefFinder web tool which analyses results using four different algorithms - BestKeeper, delta Ct, geNorm and NormFinder.

This is particularly warranted in non-model and ecologically important species for which appropriate reference genes are lacking, such as the mallard--a key reservoir of many diseases with relevance for human and livestock health. Previous studies assessing gene expression changes as a consequence of infection in mallards have nearly universally used β-actin and/or GAPDH as reference genes without confirming their suitability as normalisers. The use of reference genes at random, without regard for stability of expression across treatment groups, can result in erroneous interpretation of data. Here, eleven putative reference genes for use in gene expression studies of the mallard were evaluated, across six different tissues, using a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus infection model. Tissue type influenced the selection of reference genes, whereby different genes were stable in blood, spleen, lung, gastrointestinal tract and colon. β-actin and GAPDH generally displayed low stability and are therefore inappropriate reference genes in many cases. The use of different algorithms (GeNorm and NormFinder) affected stability rankings, but for both algorithms it was possible to find a combination of two stable reference genes with which to normalise qPCR data in mallards. These results highlight the importance of validating the choice of normalising reference genes before conducting gene expression studies in ducks.

In Study 2, the constancy of ISC detection over time (≥42 days) was assessed in oral fluid (<i>n</i> = 130), serum (<i>n</i> = 215), and feces (<i>n</i> = 132) collected from individual pigs of known PRRSV status. In Study 3, serum (<i>n</i> = 150), oral fluid (<i>n</i> = 150), and fecal samples (<i>n</i> = 75 feces, 75 fecal swabs) from commercial herds were used to establish ISC reference limits. Study 1 showed that the ISC was porcine-specific, i.e., all samples from non-porcine species were ISC negative (<i>n</i> = 34). In Study 2, the ISC was detected in all oral fluid, serum, and fecal samples, but differed in concentration between specimens (<i>p</i> < 0.05; mixed-effects regression model). The results of Study 3 were used to establish ISC reference limits for the 5th, 2.5th and 1.25th percentiles. Overall, the ISC response was consistent to the point that failure in detection is sufficient justification for re-testing and/or re-sampling.",Veterinary sciences,2023.0,Switzerland,10.3390/vetsci10060381,Journal Article,,"PRRSV, RT-qPCR, diagnostics, endogenous reference genes, internal sample control","- qPCR

It is essential to determine which plants contain the transgene and in how many copies after transgenic cotton plants are generated. A TaqMan quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Tq RT-PCR) method is described here to examine transgene copy number in transgenic cotton plants. The estimation of two transgene elements, the target gene of green fluorescence protein (GFP) and the selective gene of neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPTII), is used as an example to detail each step in Tq RT-PCR procedure, including endogenous reference gene selection, reference plasmid construction, primer-probe design, DNA extraction, real-time PCR, and data analysis. Comparing with traditional Southern hybridization analysis, this method can be used efficiently in screening large number of seedlings of T0 transgenic cotton at early stage of transformation process as well as in identifying transgene homozygotes in a segregation population.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019.0,United States,10.1007/978-1-4939-8952-2_11,Journal Article,"Base Sequence, DNA, Plant, Gene Dosage, Gossypium, Plasmids, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reproducibility of Results, Transformation, Genetic, Transgenes","Cotton (G. hirsutum), Genetic modification, Real-time PCR, TaqMan quantitative analysis, Transgene copy numbers","[TaqMan quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Tq RT-PCR), endogenous reference gene selection, reference plasmid construction, primer-probe design, DNA extraction, real-time PCR, data analysis]","[GFP-transgenic cotton plants, NPTII-transgenic cotton plants]"

The Gini coefficient characterizes such inequalities and here is used to describe the distribution of the expression of each transporter among different human tissues and cell lines. Many transporters exhibit extremely high Gini coefficients even for common substrates, indicating considerable specialization consistent with divergent evolution. The expression profiles of SLC transporters in different cell lines behave similarly, although Gini coefficients for ABC transporters tend to be larger in cell lines than in tissues, implying selection. Transporter genes are significantly more heterogeneously expressed than the members of most non-transporter gene classes. Transcripts with the stablest expression have a low Gini index and often differ significantly from the ""housekeeping"" genes commonly used for normalization in transcriptomics/qPCR studies.

Delving into gene expression research has the potential to enhance our comprehension of the molecular foundations underlying floral development. Because of its accuracy, specificity, reproducibility, and efficiency, qRT-PCR is now a biological research tool for studying expression pattern of desired genes. The gene expression investigations using qRT-PCR required a reference gene with relatively uniform expression levels in multiple biological samples, including different developmental stages, tissues, and experimental conditions. In this study, experimental sets offloral and floral organ development in the male and female plants of C. grandis, a dioecious Cucurbitaceae species, qRT-PCR profiling was performed using six reference genes as internal control with B-class floral identity gene, PISTILLATA (PI). To analyse the data, algorithms such as geNorm, NormFinder, RefFinder, and BestKeeper were used to pick out the best internal controls from a group of candidates. The optimal reference gene for qRT-PCR studies with floral samples has been recommended as β-actin combined with β-tubulin.

Different methodologies have been developed to assess the AMF-plant symbiosis. The most applied method, which involves staining of roots and microscopic observation of the AMF structures, is tedious and time-consuming and the results are highly dependent on the observer. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to quantify AMF root colonization represents a reliable, high-throughput technique that allows the assessment of numerous samples. Quantification with qPCR can be performed through two methods: relative quantification and absolute quantification. In relative quantification, the target gene is normalized with a reference gene. On the other hand, absolute quantification involves the use of a standard curve, for which template DNA is serially diluted. In a previous paper, we validated the primer pair AMG1F and AM1 for a relative quantification approach to assess AMF root colonization in Petunia. Here, we tested the same primers with an absolute quantification approach and compared the results with the traditional microscopy method. We evaluated the qPCR method with three different crops, namely, wheat (cv. Colmetta and Wiwa), tomato, and leek. We observed a strong correlation between microscopy and qPCR for Colmetta (r = 0.90, p < 0.001), Wiwa (r = 0.94, p < 0.001), and tomato (r = 0.93, p < 0.001), but no correlation for leek (r = 0.27, p = 0.268).

Developing new control strategies to combat Varroa will require the application of molecular biology, including gene expression studies by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Both high quality RNA samples and suitable stable internal reference genes are required for accurate gene expression studies. In this study, ten candidate genes (succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA), NADH dehydrogenase (NADH), large ribsosmal subunit, TATA-binding protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 18S rRNA (18S), heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), cyclophilin, α-tubulin, actin), were evaluated for their suitability as normalization genes using the geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and comparative ΔCq algorithims. Our study proposes the use of no more than two of the four most stable reference genes (NADH, 18S, SDHA and HSP90) in Varroa gene expression studies. These four genes remain stable in phoretic and reproductive stage Varroa and are unaffected by Deformed wing virus load. When used for determining changes in vitellogenin gene expression, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the relatively unstable genes actin and α-tubulin was much lower than for the stable gene combinations (NADH + HSP90 +18S; NADH + HSP90; or NADH). Using both electropherograms and RT-qPCR for short and long amplicons as quality controls, we demonstrate that high quality RNA can be recovered from Varroa up to 10 days later stored at ambient temperature if collected into RNAlater and provided the body is pierced. This protocol allows the exchange of Varroa samples between international collaborators and field sample collectors without requiring frozen collection or shipping.

Intestinal microRNAs, which can be detected in fecal samples in humans may be involved in the pathological process of HCC. Therefore, screening for functional intestinal microRNAs in fecal samples and investigating their potential roles in the molecular progression of HCC are necessary. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has been widely used in microRNA expression studies. However, few genes have been reported as reference genes for intestinal microRNAs in fecal samples. In order to obtain a more accurately analyzed intestinal microRNAs expression, we first searched for reliable reference genes for intestinal microRNAs expression normalization during qRT-PCR, using three software packages (GeNorm, NormFinder, and Bestkeeper). Next we screened and predicted the target genes of the differentially intestinal microRNAs of control and HCC mice through quantitative RT-PCR or miRtarBase. Finally, we also analyzed the mRNA targets for enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways using the DAVID Bioinformatic Resources database. This study has successfully screened relatively suitable reference genes and we have discovered that the differential intestinal microRNAs play significant roles in the development of HCC.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attract a large amount of attention in stem cell research and regeneration medicine because they possess multiple advantages and senescent MSCs could be one of the most useful stem cell models in aging studies. It is important to quantitatively evaluate senescence markers to both identify and study the mechanisms involved in MSC senescence. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is currently the most widely used tool to quantify the mRNA levels of markers. However, no report has demonstrated the optimal reference genes that should be used to normalize RT-qPCR in senescence studies of MSCs. In this study, we compared 16 commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, RPL13A, TBP, B2M, GUSB, RPLPO, YWHAZ, RPS18, EEF1A1, ATP5F1, HPRT1, PGK1, TFRC, UBC, and PPIA) in proliferating or replicative-senescent human adipose-derived MSCs (hAD-MSCs) that were isolated from seven healthy donors aged 29-59 years old. Three algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to determine the most optimal reference gene. The results showed that PPIA exhibited the most stable expression during senescence, while the widely used ACTB exhibited the lowest stability.

Porcine ECM has been proposed as a biological scaffold, and urinary bladder matrix (UBM) has demonstrated superior biological properties; however, its use in human treatment requires ensuring that it is DNA free. Several protocols have been used for decellularization and to demonstrate the absence of DNA, but until now, a porcine housekeeping gene for quantifying DNA by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) has been limiting. The aim of this study was to propose a protocol to quantify the DNA content of decellularized UBM by qPCR for the beta-actin gene (ACTB). A total of 20 porcine bladders were used, and each bladder was divided into three pieces: one as a control and the others decellularized with either SDS or Triton X-100 detergent. The presence of DNA was assessed by histology, spectrophotometry, conventional PCR, and qPCR for the ACTB. Histological analysis demonstrated the absence of nuclei using both protocols.

26118837,Insights into possible cell-death markers in the diatom Skeletonema marinoi in response to senescence and silica starvation.,"Orefice Ida, Lauritano Chiara, Procaccini Gabriele, Ianora Adrianna, Romano Giovanna","Diatoms are a hugely diverse microalgal class, which possesses unique biological features and complex metabolic pathways and may activate sophisticated mechanisms to respond to environmental changes. Abiotic stress factors may limit growth rate of diatoms, but may also trigger intracellular signaling pathways that cause cells to undergo programmed cell death (PCD). Here we investigate the gene expression of different target genes related to cell death, namely programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), developmental and cell death (DCD) domain, death specific protein (DSP) and metacaspase (MC), using RT-qPCR in the cosmopolitan coastal centric diatom species Skeletonema marinoi, which contributes significantly to phytoplankton blooms in temperate waters. To this end, we undertook a detailed study of the best reference genes to analyze gene expression in S. marinoi under different experimental conditions (i.e. in different growth phases or under silica starvation). Results showed that DSP gene expression had a clear and constant increase along the S. marinoi growth curve reaching its maximum during the senescent phase. On the contrary, PDCD4, DCD, TSG101 and MC did not show any significant variation. These findings indicate that the DSP gene is a possible PCD marker induced by aging in this diatom species. In contrast, levels of DSP transcripts induced by silica starvation were relatively low compared to those induced by cell aging suggesting differential activation and/or regulation of the PCD machinery in response to different stressful conditions. Our study also expands the list of reference genes available for the diatom S. marinoi for normalization of RT-qPCR data of cells cultivated under different growth phases or under silica starvation.",Marine genomics,2015.0,Netherlands,10.1016/j.margen.2015.06.008,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Biomarkers, Cell Death, Cellular Senescence, Diatoms, Gene Expression Regulation, Silicon Dioxide, Transcriptome","Death specific protein, Diatom, Gene expression, Nutrient starvation, Programmed cell death, Reference gene","RT-qPCR, gene expression analysis, reference genes selection, DSP gene, PDCD4 gene, TSG101 gene, DCD domain, death specific protein, metacaspase, silica starvation, growth phases.",Diatoms (Skeletonema marinoi)
30157182,Identification and validation of reference genes for qPCR in the terrestrial gastropod Cepaea nemoralis.,"Affenzeller Susanne, Cerveau Nicolas, Jackson Daniel John","Identifying and understanding mechanisms that generate phenotypic diversity is a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology. With a diversity of pigmented shell morphotypes governed by Mendelian patterns of inheritance, the common grove snail Cepaea nemoralis (Linnaeus, 1758) has been a model for evolutionary biologists and population geneticists for decades. However, the genetic mechanisms by which C. nemoralis generates this pigmented shell diversity remain unknown. An important first step in investigating this pigmentation pattern is to establish a set of validated reference genes for differential gene expression assays. Here we have evaluated eleven candidate genes for reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in C. nemoralis. Five of these were housekeeping genes traditionally employed as qPCR reference genes in other species, while six alternative genes were selected de novo from C. nemoralis transcriptome data based on the stability of their expression levels. We tested all eleven candidates for expression stability in four sub-adult tissues of C. nemoralis: pigmented mantle, unpigmented mantle, head and foot. We find that two commonly employed housekeeping genes (alpha tubulin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) are unsuitable for use as qPCR reference genes in C. nemoralis. The traditional housekeeping gene UBIquitin on the other hand performed very well. Additionally, an RNA-directed DNA polymerase (RNAP), a Potassium Channel Protein (KCHP) and a Prenylated Rab acceptor protein 1 (PRAP), identified de novo from transcriptomic data, were the most stably expressed genes in different tissue combinations. We also tested expression stability over two seasons and found that, although other genes are more stable within a single season, beta actin (BACT) and elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α) were the most reliable reference genes across seasons.",PloS one,2018.0,United States,10.1371/journal.pone.0201396,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Validation Study","Animals, Gastropoda, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",,"reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), alpha tubulin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, UBIquitin, RNA-directed DNA polymerase (RNAP), Potassium Channel Protein (KCHP), Prenylated Rab acceptor protein 1 (PRAP), beta actin (BACT), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α)","Cepaea nemoralis (common grove snail), alpha tubulin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, UBIquitin, RNA-directed DNA polymerase (RNAP), Potassium Channel Protein (KCHP), Prenylated Rab acceptor protein 1 (PRAP), beta actin (BACT), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α)"

Nonetheless, not a single study has investigated the expression stability of candidate reference genes to determine their suitability as internal controls in SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM). Using qRT-PCR, we determined expression stability of the nine most commonly used housekeeping genes, namely, TATA-box binding protein (<i>TBP</i>), cyclophilin (<i>CypA</i>), β-2-microglobulin (<i>B2M</i>), 18S rRNA (18S), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) coactivator 1 alpha (<i>PGC-1</i>α), glucuronidase beta (<i>GUSB</i>), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (<i>HPRT-1</i>), <i>β-ACTIN</i>, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<i>GAPDH</i>) in patients with COVID-19 of various severities (asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe) and those with CAM. We used statistical algorithms (delta-<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> [threshold cycle], NormFinder, BestKeeper, GeNorm, and RefFinder) to select the most appropriate reference gene and observed that clinical severity profoundly influences expression stability of reference genes. <i>CypA</i> demonstrated the most consistent expression irrespective of disease severity and emerged as the most suitable reference gene in COVID-19 and CAM. Incidentally, <i>GAPDH</i>, the most commonly used reference gene, showed the maximum variations in expression and emerged as the least suitable. Next, we determined expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (<i>NRF2</i>), interleukin-6 (<i>IL-6</i>), and <i>IL-15</i> using <i>CypA</i> and <i>GAPDH</i> as internal controls and show that <i>CypA</i>-normalized expression matches well with the RNA sequencing-based expression of these genes. Further, <i>IL-6</i> expression correlated well with the plasma levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. In conclusion, <i>GAPDH</i> emerged as the least suitable and <i>CypA</i> as the most suitable reference gene in COVID-19 and CAM. The results highlight the expression variability of housekeeping genes due to disease severity and provide a strong rationale for identification of appropriate reference genes in other chronic conditions as well. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Gene expression studies are critical to develop new diagnostics, therapeutics, and prognostic modalities. However, accurate determination of expression requires data normalization with a reference gene, whose expression does not vary across different disease stages. Misidentification of a reference gene can produce inaccurate results. Unfortunately, despite the global impact of COVID-19 and an urgent unmet need for better treatment, not a single study has investigated the expression stability of housekeeping genes across the disease spectrum to determine their suitability as internal controls. Our study identifies <i>CypA</i> and then <i>TBP</i> as the two most suitable reference genes for COVID-19 and CAM. Further, <i>GAPDH</i>, the most commonly used reference gene in COVID-19 studies, turned out to be the least suitable.

This study examined the expression stability of a panel of twelve reference genes in tissues from the female mouse reproductive axis and the uterus. Gene expression studies were carried out using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). cDNA was synthesised from RNA extracted from hypothalami, pituitaries, ovaries and uteri of female mice at ages representing weaning, puberty and adulthood as well as pregnancy (13 ± 1 days post-coitus) (n = a minimum of 3 at each age and at pregnancy). The reference genes examined included 18 s, Actb, Atp5b, B2m, Canx, Cyc1, Eif4a2, Gapdh, Rpl13a, Sdha, Ubc and Ywhaz. The RT-qPCR raw data were imported into the qBASE+ software to analyse the expression stability using GeNorm. These data were also subsequently analysed using other software packages (Delta CT, Normfinder, BestKeeper). A comprehensive ranking was conducted considering all stability rankings generated from the different software analyses. B2m and Eif4a2 deviated from the acceptable range for amplification efficiency and therefore were excluded from the further analyses. The stability of the reference genes is influenced by the software used for the analysis with BestKeeper providing markedly different results than the other analyses. GeNorm analysis of tissues taken at different ages but not including pregnant animals, indicated that the expression of the reference genes is tissue specific with the most stable genes being: in the hypothalamus, Canx and Actb; in the pituitary, Sdha and Cyc1; in the ovary, 18s, Sdha and Ubc; and in the uterus, Ywhaz, Cyc1, Atp5b, 18s and Rpl13a. The optimal number of reference genes to be used was determined to be 2 in the first three tissues while in the uterus, the V-score generated by the GeNorm analysis was higher than 0.15 suggesting that 3 or more genes should be used for normalisation. Inclusion of tissues from pregnant mice changed the reference genes identified as being the most stable: Ubc and Sdha were the most stable genes in the hypothalamus, pituitary and the ovary. The addition of pregnant tissue had no effect on the stability of the genes in uterus (Ywhaz, Cyc1, Atp5b, 18s and Rpl13a). Identification of these stable reference genes will be of use to those interested in studying female fertility and researchers should be alert to the effects of pregnancy on reference gene stability.

This experiment was mainly to study the effect of berberine on mRNA expression levels of PPARγ and adipocytokines in insulin resistant adipocytes, and investigate the molecular mechanism of berberine in enhancing insulin sensitization and application advantages of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). ddPCR absolute quantification analysis was taken in this experiment to simply and intuitively determine the appropriate reference genes. ddPCR and quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR) were used to compare the effect of different doses of berberine (10, 20, 50, 100 μmol•L⁻¹) on mRNA expression levels of PPARγ, adiponectin, resistin and leptin in IR 3T3-L1adipocytes. Antagonist GW9662 was added to study the inherent correlation between PPARγ and adiponectin mRNA expression levels. ddPCR results showed that the expression level of β-actin in adipocytes was stable, and suitable as reference gene for normalization of quantitative PCR data. Both of ddPCR and qPCR results showed that, as compared with IR models, the mRNA expression levels of adiponectin were decreased in the treatment with berberine (10, 20, 50, 100 μmol•L⁻¹) in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.01); the expression of PPARγ was decreased by 20, 50, 100 μmol•L⁻¹ berberine in a dose-dependent manner in qPCR assay (P<0.01) and decreased only by 50 and 100 μmol•L⁻¹ berberine in ddPCR assay (P<0.05). PPARγ specific antagonist GW9662 intervention experiment showed that adiponectin gene expression was directly relevant with PPARγ (P<0.05). ddPCR probe assay showed that various doses of berberine could significantly reduce mRNA expression levels of resistin and leptin (P<0.01) in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, berberine enhanced insulin sensitization effect not by up-regulating adiponect in expression of transcriptional level in PPARγ-dependent manner, but may by the elevated multimerization of adiponectin in the posttranslational regulation level.

This manuscript presents a systematic review of currently available reports of lithium's effect on BCL2 expression. To our surprise, we found that the majority of the literature does not support the effect of lithium on BCL2 transcript or protein levels. Moreover, among the positive reports, several used therapeutically irrelevant lithium doses while others lack statistical power. We also noticed that numerous low-throughput studies normalized the signal using genes/proteins affected by lithium, imposing possible bias.

In recent years, the increasing demands of A. edulis lead to a shortage of its wild resources. In order to analyze the expression of related functional genes in A. edulis, the selection of suitable internal reference genes is crucial to improve the accuracy of experimental results. Eight genes(ACT, TUA, CYP, GAPDH, UBQ, UBI, EF1a, UBC)were chosen as candidate reference genes based on the RNA-Seq. Real-time fluorescence quantitative technique was used to detect the expression level of candidate internal reference genes in different organs(bulb, leaf, flo-wer) and stolons at different development stages of A. edulis. Then GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper softwares and RefFinder website were used for a comprehensive analysis of the expression stability of the candidate genes.The results showed that among the 8 candidate reference genes, the variation range of Ct value of UBC was the smallest, and the expression level was stable, which was suitable for an reference gene. GeNorm and NormFinder software analysis showed that UBC and UBI were the optimal reference genes. BestKeeper analysis showed that CYP and UBC expression were relatively stable. Comprehensive evaluation of RefFinder website showed that UBC and UBI were the most stable genes, and ACT displayed the lowest stability in all software evaluation, indicating UBC and UBI were suitable for reference genes.

TLD 6B, a microalgae growing in the Taklamakan Desert, Xinjiang of China, is a good model material for studying the physiological and environmental adaptation mechanisms of plants in their arid habitats, as its adaptation to the harsh desert environment has led to its strong resistance. However, when using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to analyze the gene expression of this algae under abiotic stress, it is essential to find the suitable endogenous reference genes so to obtain reliable results. This study assessed the expression stability of 9 endogenous reference genes of Chlorella sp. TLD 6B under four abiotic stresses (drought, salt, cold and heat). These genes were selected based on the analysis results calculated by the three algorithmic procedures of geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, which were ranked by refinder. Our research showed that 18S and GTP under drought stress, 18S and IDH under salt stress, CYP and 18S under cold stress, GTP and IDH under heat stress were the most stable endogenous reference genes. Moreover, UBC and 18S were the most suitable endogenous reference gene combinations for all samples. In contrast, GAPDH and α-TUB were the two least stable endogenous reference genes in all experimental samples. Additionally, the selected genes have been verified to be durable and reliable by detecting POD and PXG3 genes using above endogenous reference genes.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is one of the most commonly used techniques for pathogen detection, especially for pathogens that cannot be cultivated outside their host like phytoplasma. PCR analysis requires the purification of total DNA from the sample and subsequent amplification of pathogen DNA with specific primers. The purified DNA contains mainly host DNA and only a marginal proportion is of phytoplasmal origin. Therefore, detection of phytoplasma DNA in a host DNA background must be sensitive, specific and reliable and is highly dependent on the quality and concentration of the purified DNA. DNA quality and concentration and the presence of PCR-inhibitors therefore have a direct impact on pathogen detection. Thus, it is indispensable for PCR-based diagnostic tests to validate the DNA preparation and DNA integrity before interpreting diagnostic results, especially in case that no pathogen DNA is detected. The use of an internal control allows to evaluate DNA integrity and the detection of PCR-inhibiting substances. Internal controls are generally host-specific or limited to a defined group of related species.

Many studies have reported considerable variation in the expression of reference genes (RGs) in different tissue and conditions. Therefore, screening for appropriate RGs with stable expression is crucial for functional analysis of the target gene. Two closely related crucifers Brassica juncea (cultivated) and Camelina sativa (wild) respond differently towards various abiotic and biotic stress where C. sativa exhibits higher tolerance to various stress. Comparative gene expression analysis of the target genes between two such species is the key approach to understand the mechanism of a plant's response to stress. However, using an unsuitable RG can lead to misinterpretation of expression levels of the target gene in such studies. In this investigation, the stability of seven candidate RGs including traditional housekeeping genes (HKGs) and novel candidate RGs were identified across diverse sample sets of B. juncea and C. sativa representing- hormone treated, wounded, Alternaria brassicae inoculated and combination treated samples (exogenous hormone treatment followed by A. brassicae inoculation). In this investigation, we identified stable RGs in both the species and the most suitable RGs to perform an unbiased comparative gene expression analysis between B. juncea and C. sativa. Results revealed that TIPS41 and PP2A were identified as the overall best performing RGs in both the species. However, the most suitable RG for each sample subset representing different condition must be individually selected. In Hormone treated and wounded samples TIPS41 expressed stably in both the species and in A. brassicae inoculated and combination treatment performance of PP2A was the best.

The large price difference between camel milk powder, ovine, and bovine milk powder may be an incentive for the incorporation of ovine and bovine derived foods in camel milk products. This study evaluated the use of ordinary PCR and real-time PCR for the detection of camel milk powder adulteration based on the presence of ovine and bovine milk components. DNA was extracted from camel, ovine, and bovine milk powder using a deep-processed product column DNA extraction kit. The quality of the extracted DNA was detected by amplifying the target sequence from the mitochondrial Cytb gene, and the extracted DNA was used for the identification of milk powder based on PCR analysis. In addition, PCR-based methods (both ordinary PCR and real-time PCR) were used to detect laboratory adulteration models of milk powder using primers targeting mitochondrial genes. The results show that the ordinary PCR method had better sensitivity and could qualitatively detect ovine and bovine milk components in the range of 1% to 100% in camel milk powder.

In order to better understand the key dynamic gene expression patterns during salivary gland development and functional regeneration, it is crucial to search for a panel of reliable reference genes. The present study thus aimed to identify superior reference genes to normalize gene expression data in the SMG under states of development and functional regeneration. First, the developmental SMG samples were harvested from mice in the embryonic and post‑natal periods. Functional regeneration samples from a ductal ligation/de‑ligation model were obtained at several stages. A total of 12 reference genes (<i>Actb</i>, <i>Actg1</i>, <i>Ubc</i>, <i>Uba1</i>, <i>Uba52</i>, <i>Ube2c</i>, <i>Tuba1a</i>, <i>Tuba1b</i>, <i>Tubb5</i>, <i>H2afy</i>, <i>H2afx</i> and <i>Gapdh</i>) from 430 candidates involving tubulin, histone, actin, ubiquitin and GAPDH family members were screened via transcriptome sequencing (RNA‑seq) analysis. RT‑qPCR (SYBR‑Green) and western blot analysis were then used to semi‑quantitatively assess gene and protein expression. The stability of expression was evaluated using the ΔCq, geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder and RefFinder methods and software. <i>Actg1</i> exhibited the highest stability in the SMG developmental stage, while <i>Tubb5</i> was recommended as the most stable reference gene for the SMG regenerative stage.

In order to normalise the expression of dysregulated host genes upon virus infection, analysis of stable reference housekeeping genes using quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) is necessary. In the present study, healthy and African swine fever virus (ASFV) infected porcine tissues were assessed for the expression stability of five widely used housekeeping genes (HPRT1, B2M, 18 S rRNA, PGK1 and H3F3A) as reference genes using standard algorithm. Total RNA from each tissue sample (lymph node, spleen, kidney, heart and liver) from healthy and ASFV-infected pigs was extracted and subsequently cDNA was synthesized, and subjected to qRT-PCR. Stability analysis of reference genes expression was performed using the Comparative delta CT, geNorm, BestKeeper and NormFinder algorithm available at RefFinder for the different groups. Direct Cycle threshold (CT) values of samples were used as an input for the web-based tool RefFinder. HPRT1 in spleen, 18 S rRNA in liver and kidney and H3F3A in heart and lymph nodes were found to be stable in the individual healthy tissue group (group A). The majority of the ASFV-infected organs (liver, kidney, heart, lymph node) exhibited H3F3A as stable reference gene with the exception of the ASFV-infected spleen, where HPRT1 was found to be the stable gene (group B). HPRT1 was found to be stable in all combinations of all CT values of both healthy and ASFV-infected porcine tissues (group C).

Survival strategies often include ecological and molecular adaptation strategies such as modifying body temperature (shell temperature) and expression of stress genes such as Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Estimation of gene expression through real-time qPCR is ideal for unravelling the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the stress adaptation of intertidal invertebrates. Selection of reference genes (RGs) before qPCR experiments requires a systematic assessment of RGs relating to the adaptation of the intertidal barnacles. Marine intertidal barnacles such as Amphibalanus amphitrite are infamous crustaceans from the perspective of biofouling and antifouling. They are extensively studied for their larval ecology, stress adaptation, settlement and recruitment, etc. In this study, we implemented RefFinder tool to evaluate the expression stability of RGs such as Actin muscle (ACT), 18S rRNA aminocarboxypropyltransferase-like (18S rRNA), 28S rRNA, Tubulin (TUB), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and Actin alpha (ACT-A) in adult A. amphitrite. This study is the first of its kind to investigate and validate the RGs (ACT-A and GAPDH) towards Relative Gene Expression (REGs) (fold change) using stress gene hsp90-CDC37like (HSP90). The findings of this study indicated that ACT-A and GAPDH are the most stable and ideal reference genes to perform relative gene expression (REGs) of thermally desiccated A. amphitrite. Additionally, stable RGs were validated for relative gene expression of stress gene HSP90 among thermally-desiccated A. amphitrite.

Although RG expression is assumed to be constant independent of physiological or experimental conditions, several studies have shown that commonly used RGs are not expressed stably. The use of unstable RGs has a profound effect on the conclusions drawn from studies on gene expression, and almost universally results in spurious estimation of target gene expression. Approaches aimed at selecting and validating RGs often make use of different statistical methods, which may lead to conflicting results. Based on published RG validation studies involving hypoxia the present study evaluates the expression of 5 candidate RGs (Actb, Pgk1, Sdha, Gapdh, Rnu6b) as a function of hypoxia exposure and hypothermic treatment in the neonatal rat cerebral cortex-in order to identify RGs that are stably expressed under these experimental conditions-using several statistical approaches that have been proposed to validate RGs. In doing so, we first analyzed RG ranking stability proposed by several widely used statistical methods and related tools, i.e. the Coefficient of Variation (CV) analysis, GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the ΔCt method. Using the Geometric mean rank, Pgk1 was identified as the most stable gene. Subsequently, we compared RG expression patterns between the various experimental groups. We found that these statistical methods, next to producing different rankings per se, all ranked RGs displaying significant differences in expression levels between groups as the most stable RG. As a consequence, when assessing the impact of RG selection on target gene expression quantification, substantial differences in target gene expression profiles were observed.

The plant of <i>C. quinoa</i> presents significant ecological plasticity with exceptional adaptability to several environmental stresses, including salinity. The resilience of quinoa to several abiotic stresses, as well as its nutritional attributes, have led to significant shifts in quinoa cultivation worldwide over the past century. This work first defines germination <i>sensu stricto</i> in quinoa where the breakage of the pericarp and the testa is followed by endosperm rupture (ER). Transcriptomic changes in early seed germination stages lead to unstable expression levels in commonly used reference genes that are typically stable in vegetative tissues. Noteworthy, no suitable reference genes have been previously identified specifically for quinoa seed germination under salt stress conditions. This work aims to identify these genes as a prerequisite step for normalizing qPCR data. To this end, germinating seeds from UDEC2 and UDEC4 accessions, with different tolerance to salt, have been analyzed under conditions of absence (0 mM NaCl) and in the presence (250 mM NaCl) of sodium chloride. Based on the relevant literature, six candidate reference genes, <i>Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase</i> (<i>GAPDH</i>), <i>Monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>MON1</i>), <i>Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein</i> (<i>PTB</i>), <i>Actin-7</i> (<i>ACT7</i>), <i>Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme</i> (<i>UBC</i>), and <i>18S ribosomal RNA</i> (<i>18S</i>), were selected and assessed for stability using the <i>RefFinder</i> Tool encompassing the statistical algorithms <i>geNorm</i>, <i>NormFinder</i>, <i>BestKeeper</i>, and <i>ΔCt</i> in the evaluation.

The molecular arms race led to evolutionary novelties regarding unique mechanisms of defence and detoxification in plants and insects. While insects adopt mechanisms to conquer host defence, trees develop well-orchestrated and species-specific defence strategies against insect herbivory. However, current knowledge on the molecular underpinnings of fine-tuned tree defence responses against different herbivore insects is still restricted. In the current study, using a multi-omics approach, we unveiled the defence response of <i>Populus tremula</i> against aphids (<i>Chaitophorus populialbae</i>) and spongy moths (<i>Lymantria dispar</i>) herbivory. Comparative differential gene expression (DGE) analyses revealed that around 272 and 1203 transcripts were differentially regulated in <i>P. tremula</i> after moth and aphid herbivory compared to uninfested controls. Interestingly, 5716 transcripts were differentially regulated in <i>P. tremula</i> between aphids and moth infestation. Further investigation showed that defence-related stress hormones and their lipid precursors, transcription factors, and signalling molecules were over-expressed, whereas the growth-related counterparts were suppressed in <i>P. tremula</i> after aphid and moth herbivory. Metabolomics analysis documented that around 37% of all significantly abundant metabolites were associated with biochemical pathways related to tree growth and defence. However, the metabolic profiles of aphid and moth-fed trees were quite distinct, indicating species-specific response optimization. After identifying the suitable reference genes in <i>P. tremula</i>, the omics data were further validated using RT-qPCR. Nevertheless, our findings documented species-specific fine-tuning of the defence response of <i>P. tremula,</i> showing conservation on resource allocation for defence overgrowth under aphid and moth herbivory. Such findings can be exploited to enhance our current understanding of molecular orchestration of tree responses against herbivory and aid in developing insect pest resistance <i>P. tremula</i> varieties.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024.0,Switzerland,10.3390/ijms25116124,Journal Article,"Populus, Animals, Herbivory, Transcriptome, Aphids, Moths, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Metabolomics, Gene Expression Profiling, Metabolome","Populus tremula, RT-qPCR, aphids, induced defence, reference gene analysis, spongy moth, transcriptome and metabolomics","[comparative differential gene expression analysis, transcription factors, signalling molecules, stress hormones, lipid precursors, metabolomics analysis, RT-qPCR]","<i>Populus tremula, Chaitophorus populialbae, Lymantria dispar</i>"

They have important medicinal value and great potential in the flower market. The selection of stable and reliable reference genes is a necessary prerequisite for molecular research on P. veitchii. In this study, two reference genes, Actin and GAPDH, were selected as candidate genes from the transcriptome data of P. veitchii. The expression levels of the two candidate genes in different tissues(phloem, xylem, stem, leaf, petiole, and ovary) and different growth stages(bud stage, flowering stage, and dormant stage) of P. veitchii were detected using real-time fluorescence quantitative technology(qRT-PCR). Then, the stability of the expression of the two reference genes was comprehensively analyzed using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCT, and RefFinder. The results showed that the expression patterns of Actin and GAPDH were stable in different tissues and growth stages of P. veitchii.

However, there is no reliable and effective reference genes used for the reproductive diapause study of C. nipponensis. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the expression stability of 10 candidate reference genes (Tub1, Arpc5, EF1a, 128up, RpS5, RpS26e, GAPDH, Arp3, Actin, α-Tub) in adults under diapause and nondiapause induction conditions using four statistical algorithms including GeNorm, NormFinder, Bestkeeper, and ∆CT method.

Meanwhile, to verify the reliability of the reference genes, we evaluated the relative expression levels of Vg and VgR in different treatments. Significant upregulation and downregulation in expression level of two genes in response to diapause termination and diapause fat body tissue was, respectively, observed when using Arp3 as the reference gene but not when using an unstable reference gene.

However, the extent to which these effects are realized in goose liver has not yet been fully elucidated. The object of research is to investigate the effects of four essential oil mixtures (juniper oil, mint oil, thyme oil, rosemary oil) on lipid metabolic gene expressions in goose. We measured mRNA levels of metabolic genes (ACSBG2, ELOVL1, ELOVL2, CYP2Cl9, CYP2K1), antioxidative gene (SOD1) and very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDL) synthesis genes (APOB, FOXO1, MTTP), in goose (Anser anser) liver. Search groups were formed as C (control; no additives), EK1 (0.4 mL/L essential oil mixture supplemented) and EK2 (0.8 mL/L essential oil mixture supplemented). The relative expression levels of genes in the liver were measured using RT-qPCR. β-Actin was used as reference gene control for normalization of qPCR data. As a result, essential oil supplementation downregulated metabolic genes compared to the control group. APOB gene among VLDL genes was significantly downregulated. Antioxidative effect gene was downregulated in parallel with the others.

The efficiency of localized kidney cancer surgery is limited by the damaging effects of prolonged warm ischemia and reperfusion. Ischemia/reperfusion damage to renal tissue may be related to changes in the expression profiles of pro- and antiapoptotic genes. Here, we have presented the longitudinal expression profiles of apoptosis-related genes in tissues of left and right (intact) kidneys of male rats exposed to unilateral ischemia followed by reperfusion. The profiles have been assessed at time points of 1, 3, and 48 h after the ischemic/reperfusion exposure by RT-qPCR quantification of mRNAs encoded by 13 genes, including BAX, p53, AIFM1, APAF1, CASP8, CASP3, CASP9,CASP7, MDM2, BCL2, CIAP1, XIAP, and ICAD, after normalization with respect to a reference gene ACTB.

To differentiate SVV-1 from FMDV infections, we developed a SVV-1 real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay and multiplexed with published FMDV assays. Two published FMDV assays (Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, 220, 2002, 1636; Journal of Virological Methods, 236, 2016, 258) targeting the 3D polymerase (3D) region were selected and multiplexed with the SVV-1 assay that has two targets, one in the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR, this study) and the other in the 3D region (Journal of Virological Methods, 239, 2017, 34). In silico analysis showed that the primers and probes of SVV-1 assay matched 98.3% of the strain sequences (113/115). The primer and probe sequences of the Shi FMDV assay matched 85.4% (806/944), and that of the Callahan FMDV assay matched 62.7% (592/944) of the sequences. The limit of detection (LOD) for the two multiplex RT-qPCR assays for SVV-1 was both 9 copies per reaction by cloned positive plasmids and 0.16 TCID50 per reaction by cell culture. The LOD for FMDV by both multiplex assays was 11 copies per reaction using cloned positive plasmids. With cell cultures of the seven serotypes of FMDV, the Shi assay (Journal of Virological Methods, 236, 2016, 258) had LODs between 0.04 and 0.18 TCID50 per reaction that were either the same or lower than the Callahan assay. Interestingly, multiplexing with SVV-1 increased the amplification efficiencies of the Callahan assay (Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, 220, 2002, 1636) from 51.5%-66.7% to 89.5%-96.6%. Both assays specifically detected the target viruses without cross-reacting to SVV-1 or to other common porcine viruses.

Our results demonstrated only minor difference for stability rankings among the three methods. The use of different single reference gene might influence the data interpretation, while multiple reference genes could minimize possible errors. Therefore, reference gene combinations were recommended for different tissues - the optimal reference gene combination for siphon was RPS15 and RPL17 under temperature stress, and RPL17, UBQ and TubA under salinity treatment; for pharynx, TubB, TubA and RPL17 were the most stable genes under temperature stress, while TubB, TubA and UBQ were the best under salinity stress; for intestine, UBQ, RPS15 and RPL17 were the most reliable reference genes under both treatments.

A key question surrounding crime scene stains is the length of time between deposition of the stain and its subsequent recovery, in that is the stain recovered related to the incident in question or from a previously deposited stain number of weeks earlier? The inability to answer this fundamental question has a detrimental effect upon the successful completion of a criminal investigation. Once a body fluid leaves the body, the oxygen concentration in the environment changes; therefore, it may be that this change could cause a change in the expression of hypoxia-sensitive biomarkers. Here, a range of bloodstains, liquid saliva and liquid semen samples were collected at 0 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days and 28 days of degrading at room temperature (19-22 °C), before undergoing total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis.

Unlike mice and humans, naked mole-rats do not perceive acid as a noxious stimulus, even though their sensory neurons express functional ASICs, likely an adaptation to living in a hypercapnic subterranean environment. Previous studies of ASIC expression in the mammalian nervous system have often not examined all subunits, or have failed to adequately quantify expression between tissues; to date there has been no attempt to determine ASIC expression in the central nervous system of the naked mole-rat. Here we perform a geNorm study to identify reliable housekeeping genes in both mouse and naked mole-rat and then use quantitative real-time PCR to estimate the relative amounts of ASIC transcripts in different tissues of both species.

Domestic chickens are used in a wide range of studies including neurobiology, behavior, ecology and disease transmission. In recent avian gene expression experiments, 18S (18S ribosomal RNA), beta actin (ACTB) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) have frequently been used; however, there is not enough evidence that these reference genes are suitable for all types of experiments. There is considerable evidence for lateralization in numerous learning tasks and for differences in the functional contribution of the two brain hemispheres. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify a set of reference genes for chick brain region called an intermediate medial mesopallium (IMM), which is connected with memory formation in the chick brain, whilst also taking into consideration the differences between the left and right hemispheres. This study evaluated the expression stability of eleven candidate housekeeping genes in the IMM region of the 1-day old chick brain. In our experimental system, the most reliable results were given by the NormFinder algorithm. The results show for the first time that ACTB, commonly used as an avian reference gene, is not suitable for investigation of gene expression in the chick brain and that brain lateralization exact selection of different reference gens for each hemisphere.

PBMCs were extracted from 48 females and 44 males, and gene expression was measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time QPCR). Multiple housekeeping genes (Actin-β, β2-M, GAPDH) were utilized as endogenous controls. The stability of housekeeping genes was verified using the Excel-based Bestkeeper® program. Our results showed that expression level of ABCC2 in PBMCs was 1.2-1.4 fold higher in males compared to that in females, depending on the endogenous control(s) used. However, this difference was not statistically significant. When considering using a single endogenous control gene, GAPDH and Actin-βwere found to be more suitable than β2-M. Moreover, GAPDH + Actin-β, or the combination of all three housekeeping gene as endogenous control(s) showed greater stability than other endogenous control genes for normalization of ABCC2 expression in PBMCs.

Compared to clinicopathological results, the ddPCR assay based on two out of three reference genes demonstrated superior sensitivity (82.6%), specificity (98.7%), and consistency (95.0%) in determining HER2 status over assays using single or three reference genes. Whole genome sequencing of the abnormal cases further confirmed that the ddPCR assay outperformed clinical immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and quantitative PCR (qPCR) in accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that the multi-reference gene ddPCR assay significantly improves the accuracy of HER2 status detection and reduces errors associated with chromosome 17 abnormalities. This method holds promise as a complementary or alternative approach to conventional IHC and FISH testing in tissue biopsies and is also feasible for liquid biopsies.",Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,2025.0,United States,10.1007/s12010-025-05233-0,Journal Article,"Humans, Breast Neoplasms, Female, Receptor, ErbB-2, Cell Line, Tumor, DNA Copy Number Variations, Polymerase Chain Reaction, In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence","Breast cancer, DdPCR, HER2, Multi-reference genes","[ddPCR, multi-reference genes, four-fluorescence ddPCR assay, breast cancer cell lines (T-47D and SK-BR-3), clinical breast cancer FFPE samples, sensitivity, specificity, consistency, clinicopathological results, assays using single or three reference genes, whole genome sequencing, abnormal cases, chromosome 17 abnormalities, conventional IHC, FISH testing, liquid biopsies]","[T-47D and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) over-expressing breast cancer patients, formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples]"

Combining ISH with immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine cell type provides cellular context of mRNA expression, which cannot be achieved with gene microarray or polymerase chain reaction. To study mRNA and protein expression on the same section we investigated the use of RNAscope® ISH in combination with fluorescent IHC on paraffin-embedded human brain tissue. We first developed a high-throughput, automated image analysis workflow for quantifying RNA puncta across the total cell population and within neurons identified by NeuN<sup>+</sup> immunoreactivity. We then applied this automated analysis to tissue microarray (TMA) sections of middle temporal gyrus tissue (MTG) from neurologically normal and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cases to determine the suitability of three commonly used housekeeping genes: ubiquitin C (UBC), peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) and DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1 (POLR2A). Overall, we saw a significant decrease in total and neuronal UBC expression in AD cases compared to normal cases. Total expression results were validated with RT-qPCR using fresh frozen tissue from 5 normal and 5 AD cases.

The detection of viral DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by PCR is an important diagnostic tool and, in conjunction with defined radiological and clinical features, can provide diagnosis of definite PML, avoiding the need for brain biopsy. The main aim of this study is to compare the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay with the gold standard quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the quantification of JC viral loads in clinical samples. Methods: A total of 62 CSF samples from 31 patients with PML were analyzed to compare the qPCR gold standard technique with ddPCR to detect conserved viral DNA sequences in the JCPyV genome. As part of the validation process, ddPCR results were compared to qPCR data obtained in 42 different laboratories around the world. In addition, the characterization of a novel triplex ddPCR to detect viral DNA sequence from both prototype and archetype variants and a cellular housekeeping reference gene is described. Triplex ddPCR was used to analyze the serum from six PML patients and from three additional cohorts, including 20 healthy controls (HC), 20 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who had never been treated with natalizumab (no-NTZ-treated), and 14 patients with MS who were being treated with natalizumab (NTZ-treated); three from this last group seroconverted during the course of treatment with natalizumab. Results: JCPyV DNA was detected only by ddPCR for 5 of the 62 CSF samples (8%), while remaining undetected by qPCR. For nine CSF samples (15%), JCPyV DNA was at the lower limit of quantification for qPCR, set at <250 copies/mL, and therefore no relative quantitation could be determined. By contrast, exact copies of JCPyV for each of these samples were quantified by ddPCR. No differences were observed between qPCR and ddPCR when five standardized plasma samples were analyzed for JCPyV in 42 laboratories in the United States and Europe. JCPyV-DNA was undetected in all the sera from HC and MS cohorts tested by triplex ddPCR, while serum samples from six patients with PML tested positive for JCPyV. Conclusion: This study shows strong correlation between ddPCR and qPCR with increased sensitivity of the ddPCR assay.

The role of functional genes in H. axyridis based on quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is increasingly well understood to investigate biology, physiology, feeding behavior and the role of important genes in physiological processes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a powerful and reliable technique to quantify gene expression. Using qRT-PCR, expression levels of target genes are determined based on the levels of internal reference genes; therefore, reference genes need to be stably expressed under specific experimental conditions. However, there have been no studies on the stability of reference genes used in H. axyridis. In this study, we systematically investigated expression profiles of nine candidate reference genes from H. axyridis, including β-actin (ACTIN); elongation factor 1 α (EF1A); ribosomal proteins L10, L18, L28, S13, and S15 (RPL10, RPL18, RPL28, RPS13 and RPS15); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH); and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Four analytical methods (geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and the ΔCt method) were used to evaluate the suitability of these genes as internal reference genes for three biotic factors (developmental stage, tissue, and sex) and two abiotic treatments (temperature and photoperiod). RefFinder, a comprehensive evaluation platform integrating the four analytical methods, was used to rank the overall stability of these reference genes. Among the nine candidate genes, different reference genes were identified as having the most stable expression across biotic and abiotic factors. Genes encoding ribosomal proteins typically had the most stable expression, though EF1A was the most stable across developmental stages and photoperiods. To validate the suitability of these reference genes, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) was chosen as a target. Significant up-regulation in HSP90 expression level in response to both low and high temperature was observed when using the most suitable reference genes but not when using an arbitrarily selected reference gene. The reference genes identified in this study will provide the basis for future functional genomics research in H. axyridis and will also facilitate the establishment of a standardized qRT-PCR program for other related insects.",PloS one,2018.0,United States,10.1371/journal.pone.0192521,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Coleoptera, Gene Expression Regulation, Insect Proteins, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards",,"qRT-PCR, geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder, ΔCt method, RefFinder, ACTIN, EF1A, RPL10, RPL18, RPL28, RPS13, RPS15, GAPDH, SOD, HSP90.","Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), β-actin (ACTIN), elongation factor 1 α (EF1A), ribosomal proteins L10, L18, L28, S13, and S15 (RPL10, RPL18, RPL28, RPS13 and RPS15), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)"

The available results on mRNA expression of catecholaminergic system genes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) are often contradictory. One of the possible causes might be the use of various reference genes as internal controls. In the present study, we searched for suitable reference genes in adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia of SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, which would enable reliable comparison of mRNA expression between these two strains. The mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR in adrenal medulla and superior cervical ganglia of 4-week-old or 24-week-old SHR and WKY rats. We evaluated 12 reference genes by three software tools (Normfinder, BestKeeper, geNorm) and compared them for the standardization of mRNA expression. Combination of reference genes Hprt1 and Ywhaz in adrenal medulla and Gapdh and 18S in sympathetic ganglia were chosen as the best ones. 18S was found as applicable reference gene in both tissues. We found many alterations in expression of catecholaminergic system genes in adrenal medulla and sympathetic ganglia of SHR. The usage of the most or the least stable reference gene as internal control changed results moderately in sympathetic ganglia but seriously in adrenal medulla. For example, tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) gene was underexpressed in adrenal medulla of adult SHR using the appropriate reference gene but unchanged after the standardization to the least stable reference gene.

This dual temperature adaptability necessitates establishing both temperature conditions in research to examine the effects on various biological processes. In quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays, the selection of appropriate housekeeping genes is vital for data accuracy. Nevertheless, the lack of alternatives and information often leads to the default use of the 16S rRNA gene despite potential limitations. This investigation sourced 16 potential reference genes through a comprehensive review of the literature and transcriptome sequencing data analysis. We validated the expression stability of these genes via qRT-PCR across 12 <i>Y. enterocolitica</i> strains, representing the four prevalent serotypes O:3, O:5,27, O:8, and O:9, isolated from diarrheal patient stool samples. This approach aimed to minimize the impact of serotype heterogeneity. After acquiring Cq values, gene stability was evaluated using four established algorithms-ΔCq, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper-and subsequently synthesized into a consolidated ranking through the Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) method. Our study suggests that the genes <i>glnS</i>, <i>nuoB</i>, <i>glmS</i>, <i>gyrB</i>, <i>dnaK</i>, and <i>thrS</i> maintain consistent expression across varying culture temperatures, supporting their candidacy as robust housekeeping genes.

This discovery is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of qRT-PCR data, as the choice of appropriate reference genes is key to normalizing expression data and minimizing experimental variability. Importantly, our research extended beyond bioinformatics analysis by incorporating validation with clinical strains, bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and practical application. This approach not only underscores the robustness and reliability of our findings but also directly addresses the critical need for experimental validation in the field.

The main aim of this study was to identify the most stably expressed reference genes to study the effect of these molecules on genes in a strong biofilm producing <i>S. aureus</i> isolate isolated from biofilm-related infection. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed by using relative quantification method. Four different algorithms, delta Ct, normfinder, bestkeeper, and genorm, followed by a comprehensive analysis was used to identify the most stable reference genes from a list of sixteen different candidate reference genes. All four algorithms reported different results, with some comparable findings among some methods.

However, the process of cataloging CNVs has been slow because of the cumbersome nature and low reliability of the procedures involved. Here we describe a simple quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) method for screening of medicolegally useful CNVs, which does not require reference DNA with known copy number. The first step is to prepare a chimeric plasmid vector including one copy each of the single-copy gene-specific sequence as the internal standard, and the target CNV-specific sequence. To assess the validity of this new method, we analyzed CNVs in the LTBP1 and ETV6 gene regions, both of which are candidate CNVs associated with body height. The PCR efficiencies for the single-copy (reference) gene and the target CNV were similar, indicating that quantitation was reliable. Furthermore, simulated analysis of the LTBP1 CNV using mock samples prepared by mixing vectors in varying proportions showed that this analytical method allowed correct determination of the LTBP1 copy number. These results demonstrated that our simple method has considerable potential for screening of trait-related CNVs that would be useful for forensic casework.","Legal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2017.0,Ireland,10.1016/j.legalmed.2017.01.006,Journal Article,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, DNA Copy Number Variations, Female, Forensic Medicine, Humans, Male, Mass Screening, Middle Aged, Phenotype","Copy number variation (CNV), Detection method, Personal identification, Physical feature","Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR), chimeric plasmid vector, single-copy gene-specific sequence, target CNV-specific sequence, PCR efficiencies.","[Homo sapiens (implied, as the study is about humans)]

Here we evaluated the suitability of a set of reference genes (Actb, Gapdh, Tbp, Pgk1 and Sdha) using samples from early mouse embryo tissues that are widely used in research (somites, prosencephalon and heart) at different developmental stages. The comparative ΔCq method and five software packages (NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, DataAssist and RefFinder) were used to rank the most stable genes while GenEx and GeNorm programs determined the optimal total number of reference genes for a reliable normalization. The ranking of most reliable reference genes was different for each tissue evaluated: (1) in somite from embryos with 16-18 somite pairs stage, the combination of Pgk1 and Actb provided the best normalization and Actb also presented high stability levels at an earlier developmental stage; (2) Gapdh is the most stable gene in prosencephalon in the two developmental stages tested; and (3) in heart samples, Sdha, Gapdh and Actb were the best combination for qPCR normalization. The analysis of these three tissues simultaneously indicated the combination of Gapdh, Actb and Tbp as the most reliable internal control.

Upon accumulation of the UPR-converted XBP1 mRNA splicing from an unspliced (u) XBP1 (inactive) isoform to the spliced (s) XBP1 (active) isoform, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α (IRE1α) removes a 26-nucleotide intron from uXBP1 mRNA. Recent studies have reported the assessment of ER stress by examining the ratio of sXBP1 to uXBP1 mRNA (s/uXBP1 ratio) via densitometric analysis of PCR bands relative to increased levels of sXBP1 to uXBP1 using a housekeeping gene for normalization. However, this measurement is visualized by gel electrophoresis, making it very difficult to quantify differences between the two XBP1 bands and complicating data interpretation. Moreover, most commonly used housekeeping genes display an unacceptably high variable expression pattern of the s/uXBP1 ratio under different experimental conditions, such as various phases of development and different cell types, limiting their use as internal controls. For a more quantitative determination of XBP1 splicing activity, we measured the expression levels of total XBP1 (tXBP1: common region of s/uXBP1) and sXBP1 via real-time PCR using specific primer sets. We also designed universal real-time PCR primer sets capable of amplifying a portion of each u/s/tXBP1 mRNA that is highly conserved in eukaryotes, including humans, monkeys, cows, pigs, and mice.

Due to the unavailability of complete genome sequences and relatively poor genetic background information of the Chinese fir, it is necessary to identify and analyze the expression levels of suitable housekeeping genes (HKGs) as internal reference for precise analysis. Based on the results of database analysis and transcriptome sequencing, we have chosen five candidate HKGs (Actin, GAPDH, EF1a, 18S rRNA, and UBQ) with conservative sequences in the Chinese fir and related species for quantitative analysis. The expression levels of these HKGs in roots and cotyledons under five different abiotic stresses in different time intervals were measured by qRT-PCR. The data were statistically analyzed using the following algorithms: NormFinder, BestKeeper, and geNorm. Finally, RankAggreg was applied to merge the sequences generated from three programs and rank these according to consensus sequences. The expression levels of these HKGs showed variable stabilities under different abiotic stresses. Among these, Actin was the most stable internal control in root, and GAPDH was the most stable housekeeping gene in cotyledon.

Methods The expression of five potential housekeeping genes GAPDH, RPNI, PUM1, B2M, and PMM1 was analyzed through qPCR and Bestkeeper software (http://www.wzw.tum.de/gene-quantification/bestkeeper.html) in 20 stage II-IV rectal cancer samples to check for uniformity in their expression pattern. Cancer stem cell (CSC) marker ALDH1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker (EMT) markers E cadherin, vimentin, Twist, and SNAI2 expression were evaluated in conjunction with the two optimal reference genes in 10 rectal cancers as part of validation. Results The standard deviation of the cycle threshold value of GAPDH was found the lowest at 0.65 followed by RPN1 at 0.88, PUM1 at 0.94, PMM1 at 0.94, and B2M at 1.21 when analyzed with BestKeeper software. Using GAPDH and PUM1 as the reference gene for the validation phase, rectal cancer patients with stage III/IV showed a 4.79-fold change (P=0.006) in ALDH1 expression, and an 11.76-fold change in Twist expression (P=0.003) with respect to stage II rectal tumor when normalized with GAPDH and PUM1. Conclusion GAPDH and PUM1 can be used as an optimal set of housekeeping genes for gene expression-related experiments in rectal tumors. ALDH1 and Twist were found significantly overexpressed in stage III/IV rectal tumors in comparison to stage II rectal cancer.

To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying honey bee colony management, it is important to investigate the expression of genes putatively involved in colony physiology. Although quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) can be used to quantify the relative expression of target genes, internal reference genes (which are stably expressed across different conditions) must first be identified to ensure accurate normalisation of target genes. To identify reliable reference genes in honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies, therefore, we evaluated seven candidate genes (ACT, EIF, EF1, RPN2, RPS5, RPS18 and GAPDH) in samples collected from three honey bee tissue types (head, thorax and abdomen) across all four seasons using three analysis programmes (NormFinder, BestKeeper and geNorm). Subsequently, we validated various normalisation methods using each of the seven reference genes and a combination of multiple genes by calculating the expression of catalase (CAT). Although the genes ranked as the most stable gene were slightly different on conditions and analysis methods, our results suggest that RPS5, RPS18 and GAPDH represent optimal honey bee reference genes for target gene normalisation in qRT-PCR analysis of various honey bee tissue samples collected across seasons.",Scientific reports,2020.0,England,10.1038/s41598-020-70965-4,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Bees, DNA Primers, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling, Organ Specificity, Pupa, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards, Transcriptome",,"[ACT, EIF, EF1, RPN2, RPS5, RPS18, GAPDH, NormFinder, BestKeeper, geNorm]","Honey bees (Apis mellifera), seven candidate genes: ACT, EIF, EF1, RPN2, RPS5, RPS18 and GAPDH."

Cellular responses to tendon injury are complex, involving inflammatory and repair components, with the latter employing both resident and recruited exogenous cell populations. Gene expression analyses are valuable tools for investigating tendon injury, allowing assessment of repair processes and pathological responses such as fibrosis, and permitting evaluation of therapeutic pharmacological interventions. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a commonly used approach for such studies, but data obtained by this method must be normalised to reference genes: genes known to be stably expressed between the experimental conditions investigated. Establishing suitable tendon injury reference genes is thus essential. Accordingly we investigated mRNA expression stability in a rat model of tendon injury, comparing both injured and uninjured tendons, and the effects of rapamycin treatment, at 1 and 3 weeks post injury. We used 11 candidate genes (18S, ACTB, AP3D1, B2M, CSNK2A2, GAPDH, HPRT1, PAK1IP1, RPL13a, SDHA, UBC) and assessed stability via four complementary algorithms (Bestkeeper, deltaCt, geNorm, Normfinder). Our results suggests that ACTB, CSNK2A2, HPRT1 and PAK1IP1 are all stably expressed in tendon, regardless of injury or drug treatment: any three of these would serve as universally suitable reference gene panel for normalizing qPCR expression data in the rat tendon injury model.

More than 95% of SMA cases have a homozygous deletion of exon 7 of the <i>SMN1</i> gene. Disease expression mainly depends on the copy number of <i>SMN2</i>, a hypomorphic copy of <i>SMN1</i>. Many countries in the world have implemented newborn screening (NBS) programs for early identification and treatment of children with SMA. We herein present the first two-year results of the SMA NBS program in Campania, a region with one of the highest birth rates in Italy. Genomic DNA was extracted from dried blood spots (DBS) and peripheral blood. For DBS, the <i>SMN1</i> gene copy number was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting <i>SMN1</i> exon 7 and a reference gene (<i>RPP30</i>). In positive newborns and their parents, <i>SMN1</i>/<i>SMN2</i> copies were evaluated by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA). We analyzed 77,945 newborns and identified 11 positive children. Six patients had 2 copies of <i>SMN2</i>, but only one showed severe SMA-related signs at birth. Eligible newborns were treated with gene therapy within 20 days of birth. Notably, qPCR failed to amplify the reference <i>RPP30</i> gene in 10/77,945 DBS. Despite this limitation, we observed that about 1/40 DBS had ΔCt values consistent with the presence of one <i>SMN1</i> copy. The semi-automated procedure used for SMA NBS showed excellent performance in detecting the presence of homozygous deletion of <i>SMN1</i> exon 7, with the exception of a few cases with the absence of amplification of the reference gene.

Some flax lines can undergo heritable phenotypic and genotypic changes (LIS-1 insertion being the most common) in response to nutrient stress and are called plastic lines. Offspring of plastic lines, which stably inherit the changes, are called genotrophs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in a crucial regulatory mechanism of gene expression. They have previously been assumed to take part in nutrient stress response and can, therefore, participate in genotroph formation. In the present study, we performed high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs (sRNAs) extracted from flax plants grown under normal, phosphate deficient and nutrient excess conditions to identify miRNAs and evaluate their expression. Our analysis revealed expression of 96 conserved miRNAs from 21 families in flax. Moreover, 475 novel potential miRNAs were identified for the first time, and their targets were predicted. However, none of the identified miRNAs were transcribed from LIS-1. Expression of seven miRNAs (miR168, miR169, miR395, miR398, miR399, miR408, and lus-miR-N1) with up- or down-regulation under nutrient stress (on the basis of high-throughput sequencing data) was evaluated on extended sampling using qPCR. Reference gene search identified ETIF3H and ETIF3E genes as most suitable for this purpose. Down-regulation of novel potential lus-miR-N1 and up-regulation of conserved miR399 were revealed under the phosphate deficient conditions.

30251045,Development and evaluation of gene expression biomarkers for chemical pollution in common frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles.,"Carlsson Gunnar, Tydén Eva","Pollutants have been proposed as one factor in the worldwide declines of amphibian species and populations. Applying gene expression analysis of liver RNA in tadpoles would be a possible approach for biomarker measurements to increase knowledge of ecological health in amphibian populations. The major aim of this study was to explore the relevance of applying gene expression analyses of cytochrome p450 (cyp1a), metallothionein (mt), and vitellogenin (vtg) in Rana temporaria tadpoles. Therefore, tadpoles were exposed for 1 week to β-naphthoflavone (BNF), cadmium chloride (CdCl<sub>2</sub>), and ethinylestradiol (EE2). Primers were developed for RT-qPCR to analyze gene expression in livers. The result showed that the methods for gene expression analyses of cyp1a, mt, and vtg as well as the reference gene β-actin (bact) were successful not only in R. temporaria but also in another amphibian, Rana arvalis. The gene expression of cyp1a was induced by BNF and the gene expression of mt was induced by CdCl<sub>2</sub> but no significant induction was recorded in vtg expression after exposure to EE2. Gene expressions varied throughout the tadpole metamorphosis development, in particular for vtg. Overall, the use of gene expression of cyp1a and mt as biomarkers in wild tadpoles seems promising while the use of vtg seems less relevant due to high natural variation and low background expression. The study shows that variations in gene expressions between tadpoles of different genetic origin are important to consider when evaluating the data.

In this study, we developed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to rapidly and accurately detect 22 <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species by selecting genetic markers using comparative genomic analysis. A total of 210 <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genome sequences were compared to select species- or subspecies-specific genetic markers. A phylogenetic tree based on pan-genomes generated clusters according to <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species or subspecies except that two strains were not grouped with their subspecies.

The main purpose of this work was to verify the Real Time PCR and the Digital PCR (dPCR) quantification performances on baby food samples, specifically selected for their high miscibility to limit variability; chicken was selected as target to verify the performance of quantification of methods after having spiked the same quantity in different baby foods. The other aims were: (1) to verify a constant genome copies ratio existence between mammalian and avian species (2) to verify the dPCR performance, set up on housekeeping, to quantify mammalian and avian species in commercial products. Digital PCR showed fewer differences respect to Real Time PCR, at the same 15% w/w chicken spiking level. Despite the constant difference between mammalian and avian genome copies, in samples with the same spiking weight, the confidence intervals increasing towards the extreme values, made impossible to use genome copies ratio as a sort of correction factor between species.

Using eggs as a control, 48, 43, and 39 microRNAs were upregulated, and 3, 10, and 9 were downregulated in larvae, nymphs, and adults, respectively. MicroRNA-1 (miR-1) was expressed in high abundance throughout <i>Ha. anatolicum</i> development, with an average of nearly one million transcripts, and it is highly conserved among tick species. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) showed that miR-1 expression gradually increased with tick development, reaching the highest level at engorgement. Differential tissue expression was detected, with significantly higher levels in the salivary glands and epidermis than in the midgut. Inhibition assays showed no significant change in body weight or spawning time or amount between experimental and control groups, but there was a significant difference (<i>p</i> < 0.01) in engorgement time. With miR-1 inhibition, ticks displayed obvious deformities during later development. To more fully explain the microRNA mechanism of action, the miR-1 cluster was analyzed according to the target gene; members that jointly act on Hsp60 include miR-5, miR-994, miR-969, and miR-1011. Therefore, microRNAs are critical for normal tick development, and the primary structure of the mature sequence of miR-1 is highly conserved. Nonetheless, different developmental stages and tissues show different expression patterns, with a certain role in prolonging feeding. miR-1, together with other cluster members, regulates mRNA function and may be used as a molecular marker for species origin, evolution analysis, and internal reference gene selection.",Frontiers in physiology,2021.0,Switzerland,10.3389/fphys.2021.596289,Journal Article,,"Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum, biological function, miR-1, microRNA, ticks","high-throughput sequencing, qPCR, miR-1, miR-5, miR-969, miR-994, miR-1011, Hsp60.","<i>Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum</i>, miR-1, miR-5, miR-969, miR-994, miR-1011, Hsp60."
26555275,With Reference to Reference Genes: A Systematic Review of Endogenous Controls in Gene Expression Studies.,"Chapman Joanne R, Waldenström Jonas","The choice of reference genes that are stably expressed amongst treatment groups is a crucial step in real-time quantitative PCR gene expression studies. Recent guidelines have specified that a minimum of two validated reference genes should be used for normalisation. However, a quantitative review of the literature showed that the average number of reference genes used across all studies was 1.2. Thus, the vast majority of studies continue to use a single gene, with β-actin (ACTB) and/or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) being commonly selected in studies of vertebrate gene expression. Few studies (15%) tested a panel of potential reference genes for stability of expression before using them to normalise data. Amongst studies specifically testing reference gene stability, few found ACTB or GAPDH to be optimal, whereby these genes were significantly less likely to be chosen when larger panels of potential reference genes were screened. Fewer reference genes were tested for stability in non-model organisms, presumably owing to a dearth of available primers in less well characterised species. Furthermore, the experimental conditions under which real-time quantitative PCR analyses were conducted had a large influence on the choice of reference genes, whereby different studies of rat brain tissue showed different reference genes to be the most stable.

Gene expression is frequently induced by herbicide safeners and implies the encoded enzymes serve a role in herbicide metabolism and detoxification. Cloquintocet-mexyl (CM) is a safener commonly utilized with halauxifen-methyl (HM), a synthetic auxin herbicide whose phytotoxic form is halauxifen acid (HA). Our first objective was to identify candidate HA-detoxifying genes via RNA-Seq by comparing untreated and CM-treated leaf tissue. On average, 81% of RNA-Seq library reads mapped uniquely to the reference genome and 76.4% of reads were mapped to a gene. Among the 103 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functional annotations indicate the majority of DEGs encode proteins associated with herbicide or xenobiotic metabolism. This finding was further corroborated by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, where several genes were assigned GO terms indicating oxidoreductase activity (34 genes) and transferase activity (45 genes). One of the significant DEGs is a member of the CYP81A subfamily of cytochrome P450s (CYPs; denoted as CYP81A-5A), which are of interest due to their ability to catalyze synthetic auxin detoxification. To investigate CYP expression induced by HM and/or CM, our second objective was to measure gene-specific expression of CYP81A-5A and its homoeologs (CYP81A-5B and CYP81A-5D) in untreated leaf tissue and leaf tissue treated with CM and HM over time using RT-qPCR. Relative to the reference gene (β-tubulin), basal CYP expression is high, expression among these CYPs varies over time, and expression for all CYPs is CM-inducible but not HM-inducible.

39791752,The Influence of Cell Isolation and Culturing on Natriuretic Peptide Receptors in Aortic Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells.,"Rager Christine, Klöpper Tobias, Tasch Sabine, Whittaker Michael Raymond, Exintaris Betty, Mietens Andrea, Middendorff Ralf","Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) relaxation by guanylyl cyclases (GCs) and cGMP is mediated by NO and its receptor soluble GC (sGC) or natriuretic peptides (NPs) ANP/BNP and CNP with the receptors GC-A and GC-B, respectively. It is commonly accepted that cultured SMCs differ from those in intact vessels. Nevertheless, cell culture often remains the first step for signaling investigations and drug testing. Previously, we showed that even popular reference genes changed dramatically after SMC isolation from aorta. Regarding NP receptors, a substantial amount of data relies on cell culture. We hypothesize that the NP/cGMP system in intact aortic tunica media differs from isolated and cultured aortic SMCs. Therefore, we studied isolation and culturing effects on the expression of NP receptors GC-A, GC-B, and NP clearance receptor (NPRC) compared to sGC. We investigated intact tunica media and primary SMCs from the longitudinal halves of the same rat aorta. GC activity was monitored by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In addition, we hypothesize that there are sex-dependent differences in the NP/cGMP cascade in both intact tissue and cultured cells. We, therefore, analyzed a male and female cohort. Expression was quantified by RT-qPCR comparing aortic media and SMCs with our recently validated reference gene (RG) small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 2 (U2). Only GC-A was stably expressed. In intact media, GC-A exceeded GC-B and NPRC. However, GC-B, NPRC, and sGC were dramatically upregulated in cultured SMCs of the same aortae different from the stable GC-A. The expression was mirrored by NP-induced GC activity. In cultured cells, changes in GC activity were delayed compared to receptor expression. Minor differences between both sexes could also be revealed. Thus, isolation and culture fundamentally alter the cGMP system in vascular SMCs with potential impact on drug testing and scRNAseq. Especially, the dramatic increase in the clearance receptor NPRC in culture might distort all physiological ANP, BNP, and CNP effects.",Cells,2025.0,Switzerland,10.3390/cells14010051,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Muscle, Smooth, Vascular, Receptors, Atrial Natriuretic Factor, Male, Rats, Female, Aorta, Myocytes, Smooth Muscle, Cells, Cultured, Cyclic GMP, Cell Separation, Rats, Wistar, Cell Culture Techniques","aorta, biological sex, cGMP signaling, natriuretic peptides, nitric oxide, phenotype switch, vascular smooth muscle cells","RT-qPCR, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) monitoring, reference gene (U2) validation, sex comparison, GC activity measurement, GC-A, GC-B, NPRC, sGC, NP-induced GC activity, receptor expression, culture, drug testing, scRNAseq.","[rat vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), guanylyl cyclases (GCs), soluble GC (sGC), natriuretic peptides (NPs), ANP, BNP, CNP, GC-A, GC-B, NP clearance receptor (NPRC)]"

Copies of HIV RNA measured by qPCR, are often normalized to the input RNA or cell number. However, these could be affected by biological variability and/or technical errors, which can be avoided by using an internal reference gene. To obtain reliable data, it is essential to select stable reference genes (RGs) of which the expression is not influenced by biological variability, the type of cells, or the LRAs used. However, to date, no study has carefully evaluated RG stability following LRA exposure. We analyzed the stability of six widely used RGs (<i>GAPDH</i>, <i>TBP</i>, <i>YWHAZ</i>, <i>UBE2D2</i>, <i>HPRT1</i> and <i>RPL27A</i>) in human PBMC and CD4+ T cells. LRA exposure significantly influenced the stability of these RGs. Overall, <i>TBP</i>, <i>UBE2D2</i>, and <i>RPL27A</i> were the most stable RGs in all tested conditions. <i>TBP</i> was generally the most stable RG whereas <i>GAPDH</i> varied the most. Finally, we evaluated the impact of applying different RG normalizers to host genes and HIV ca-RNA data. Altered results were observed both in host and HIV gene expression when unstable RGs were used. Our data underline the importance of testing the stability of RGs utilized to evaluate LRA-induced HIV ca-RNA expression. To our knowledge, this is the first careful evaluation of the stability of RGs after LRA exposure and will significantly contribute to the quality of data analysis in regard to gene expression.<b>IMPORTANCE</b>Latency-reversing agents (LRAs) are ubiquitously used in the ""shock-and-kill"" HIV cure strategy and their performance is often evaluated by ex-vivo quantification of cell associated HIV RNA. HIV RNA, measured by qPCR, is often normalized to internal reference genes, but the expression of these genes should not be influenced by the experimental settings. We found that treatment of human PBMC and CD4+ T cells with LRAs significantly altered the expression of several commonly used reference genes, such as GAPDH. Finally, we evaluate the impact of different reference genes on normalization of host genes and HIV cell associated RNA expression and demonstrated that using unstable reference genes dramatically altered experimental outcome. Our data highlight the importance of using reference genes that are unaffected by LRAs under study to correctly evaluate host gene and cell associated HIV RNA expression induced by latency-reversing agents.",Journal of virology,2021.0,United States,10.1128/JVI.02305-20,Journal Article,,,"[qPCR, normalization to input RNA or cell number, internal reference genes, GAPDH, TBP, YWHAZ, UBE2D2, HPRT1, RPL27A, stability evaluation, LRAs, human PBMC, CD4+ T cells, ex-vivo quantification, shock-and-kill HIV cure strategy]

The Bartonella spp. ddPCR assay was developed based upon previously published TaqMan-based qPCR assays that can amplify DNA of over 25 Bartonella spp. Host DNA (housekeeping gene) amplification serves as a reference target to facilitate quantification. The efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity of the Bartonella spp. ddPCR assay was assessed by direct comparison with the current qPCR methods used by the Intracellular Pathogens Research Laboratory (North Carolina State University, North Carolina, USA), and Galaxy Diagnostics (Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA). Bartonella spp. ddPCR assay parameters were successfully optimized to detect Bartonella concentrations equivalent to 0.5 bacterial genome copies per microliter of blood (0.001 pg/ul of bacterial DNA). The number of droplets detected (resolution) for each concentration was consistent across each of four assessed time points. The Bartonella spp. ddPCR assay detected 16 species/strains including B. henselae; B. quintana; B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii (genotypes I, II, III and IV); B. vinsonii subsp. vinsonii; B. melophagi; B. volans; B. monaki; B. alsatica; B. bovis; B. elizabethae; B. clarridgeiae; and B. koehlerae.

However, this approach requires the use of stable reference genes to normalize the data. Chlorops oryzae causes significant economic damage to rice crops throughout Asia. The lack of suitable reference genes has hindered research on the molecular mechanisms underlying many physiological processes of this species. In this study, we used quantitative real-time PCR to evaluate the expression of eight C. oryzae housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), β-actin (βACT), beta-tubulin (βTUB), Delta Elongation factor-1 (EF1δ), ribosomal protein S11 (RPS11), RPS15, C-terminal-Binding Protein (CtBP), and ribosomal protein 49 (RP49) in different developmental stages and tissues in both larvae and adults. We analyzed the data with four different software packages: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder and compared the results obtained with each method. The results indicate that PRS15 and RP49 can be used as stable reference genes for quantifying gene expression in different developmental stages and larval tissues. GAPDH and βACT, which have been considered stable reference genes by previous studies, were the least stable of the candidate genes with respect to larval tissues. GAPDH was, however, the most stable reference gene for adult tissues.

27077048,Optimization of digital droplet polymerase chain reaction for quantification of genetically modified organisms.,"Gerdes Lars, Iwobi Azuka, Busch Ulrich, Pecoraro Sven","Digital PCR in droplets (ddPCR) is an emerging method for more and more applications in DNA (and RNA) analysis. Special requirements when establishing ddPCR for analysis of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in a laboratory include the choice between validated official qPCR methods and the optimization of these assays for a ddPCR format. Differentiation between droplets with positive reaction and negative droplets, that is setting of an appropriate threshold, can be crucial for a correct measurement. This holds true in particular when independent transgene and plant-specific reference gene copy numbers have to be combined to determine the content of GM material in a sample. Droplets which show fluorescent units ranging between those of explicit positive and negative droplets are called 'rain'. Signals of such droplets can hinder analysis and the correct setting of a threshold. In this manuscript, a computer-based algorithm has been carefully designed to evaluate assay performance and facilitate objective criteria for assay optimization. Optimized assays in return minimize the impact of rain on ddPCR analysis. We developed an Excel based 'experience matrix' that reflects the assay parameters of GMO ddPCR tests performed in our laboratory. Parameters considered include singleplex/duplex ddPCR, assay volume, thermal cycler, probe manufacturer, oligonucleotide concentration, annealing/elongation temperature, and a droplet separation evaluation. We additionally propose an objective droplet separation value which is based on both absolute fluorescence signal distance of positive and negative droplet populations and the variation within these droplet populations. The proposed performance classification in the experience matrix can be used for a rating of different assays for the same GMO target, thus enabling employment of the best suited assay parameters. Main optimization parameters include annealing/extension temperature and oligonucleotide concentrations. The droplet separation value allows for easy and reproducible assay performance evaluation. The combination of separation value with the experience matrix simplifies the choice of adequate assay parameters for a given GMO event.",Biomolecular detection and quantification,2016.0,Germany,10.1016/j.bdq.2015.12.003,Journal Article,,"ABI, LifeTechnologies (formerly AppliedBiosystems), Bio, DNA Technology/Biosearch Technologies, Cat.

Herb, a perennial grass species, produces a unique variety of pharmacologically active Amaryllidaceae alkaloids. However, the key enzymes and their expression pattern involved in the biosynthesis of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (especially for galanthamine) are far from being fully understood. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), a commonly used method for quantifying gene expression, requires stable reference genes to normalize its data. In this study, to choose the appropriate reference genes under different experimental conditions, 14 genes including YLS8 (mitosis protein YLS8), CYP2 (Cyclophilin 2), CYP 1 (Cyclophilin 1), TIP41 (TIP41-like protein), EXP2 (Expressed protein 2), PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1), EXP1 (Expressed protein 1), PP2A (Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A), β-TUB (β-tubulin), α-TUB (α-tubulin), EF1-α (Elongation factor 1-α), UBC (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), ACT (Actin) and GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were selected from the transcriptome datasets of L. aurea. And then, expressions of these genes were assessed by qRT-PCR in various tissues and the roots under different treatments. The expression stability of the 14 candidates was analyzed by three commonly used software programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper), and their results were further integrated into a comprehensive ranking based on the geometric mean. The results show the relatively stable genes for each subset as follows: (1) EXP1 and TIP41 for all samples; (2) UBC and EXP1 for NaCl stress; (3) PTBP1 and EXP1 for heat stress, polyethylene glycol (PEG) stress and ABA treatment; (4) UBC and CYP2 for cold stress; (5) PTBP1 and PP2A for sodium nitroprusside (SNP) treatment; (6) CYP1 and TIP41 for methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment; and (7) EXP1 and TIP41 for various tissues.

Traditional methods for PMI estimation are limited by constraints and inaccuracies. Circular RNA (circRNA), formed through exon or intron looping to create a complete circular structure without a 5' end cap and a 3' poly(A) tail, exhibits exceptional stability, abundance, and tissue-specific characteristics that make it potentially valuable for PMI estimation. However, research on the exploration or application of circRNA in PMI estimation has been limited. This study aims to investigate the correlation between circRNA and PMI. In this study, liver tissue samples were collected from mice at six different time points at 4 °C, 18 °C, 25 °C, and 35 °C, respectively. The reference gene <i>28S</i> rRNA and the biomarker <i>circRnf169</i> were successfully screened. Quantitative PCR was employed to examine the correlation between <i>circRnf169</i> levels and PMI. At 4 °C, the level of <i>circRnf169</i> decreased with prolonged PMI, whereas at 18 °C, 25 °C, and 35 °C, the <i>circRnf169</i> RNA was degraded rapidly, indicating that <i>circRnf169</i> is suitable for PMI estimation at low temperatures or early PMI.

We here present proteomic profiles of cells overexpressing or knocked down for hTERT. This study also attempts to find out the potential interacting partners of hTERT in cancer cell lines. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) of two different cell lines U2OS (a naturally hTERT negative cell line) and HeLa revealed differential expression of proteins in hTERT over-expressing cells. In U2OS cell line 28 spots were picked among which 23 spots represented upregulated and 5 represented down regulated proteins. In HeLa cells 21 were upregulated and 2 were down regulated out of 23 selected spots under otherwise identical experimental conditions. Some heat shock proteins viz. Hsp60 and Hsp70 and GAPDH, which is a housekeeping gene, were found similarly upregulated in both the cell lines. The upregulation of these proteins were further confirmed at RNA and protein level by real-time PCR and western blotting respectively.",PloS one,2017.0,United States,10.1371/journal.pone.0181027,Journal Article,"Cell Line, Tumor, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, HeLa Cells, Humans, Neoplasms, Proteome, Proteomics, Telomerase",,"Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), western blotting, real-time PCR.","hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase), U2OS (a naturally hTERT negative cell line), HeLa (cancer cell line)

30878465,Estimating time since deposition using quantification of RNA degradation in body fluid-specific markers.,"Alshehhi Suaad, Haddrill Penelope R","The first appearance of ribonucleic acid (RNA) in forensic science research was in 1984 in the study of post-mortem tissues. Since then, many studies have explored the role of gene expression and its potential applications in forensic science. The two main RNA molecules that have been subject to increasing interest in the forensic science community are messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). Identification of body fluid type and estimating the time since deposition can be of immense value to criminal investigations. Determining the time since deposition or age of a biological stain can help to indicate either when a crime happened, or whether the biological evidence was deposited before/after a known crime event, in order for samples to be excluded. The research presented here has used reverse transcription quantitative PCR to examine the relative expression ratio (RER) in two types of body fluid-specific markers (saliva and semen), to develop a method to estimate the age of biological stains. mRNA and miRNA markers specific to saliva and semen, along with three reference genes were selected. Biological samples from 20 participants were stored in a dark dry place at room temperature to simulate natural ageing. A series of desired ageing points were set and total RNA was extracted when samples reached each desired point. The degradation behaviour of each RNA marker was analysed, showing that they exhibited unique degradation profiles across a one-year storage interval for saliva and semen samples, where miRNAs and the U6 reference gene were shown to have high stability. The RERs exhibit a non-linear relationship with body fluid stain age and can be considered as a potential method for body fluid stain age estimation, hence the time since deposition.",Forensic science international,2019.0,Ireland,10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.02.046,Journal Article,"Actins, Forensic Genetics, Genetic Markers, Humans, Male, MicroRNAs, Protamines, RNA Stability, RNA, Messenger, RNA, Ribosomal, 18S, RNA, Small Nuclear, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Saliva, Salivary Proteins and Peptides, Semen, Time Factors","Body fluid identification, RER, Time since deposition, mRNA, microRNA","reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), mRNA, microRNA (miRNA), saliva, semen, reference genes (U6), RNA marker degradation analysis, relative expression ratio (RER), body fluid stain age estimation.","messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA), saliva, semen."

Telomere shortening is supposed to contribute to genomic instability and crucially involved in process of carcinogenesis. Peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) telomere length was previously investigated in several studies as potential biomarker for CRC but with controversial results. This prompted us to investigate relative PBL telomere length in association with different histological findings throughout the continuum of colorectal carcinogenesis in order to reflect the whole spectrum of putative CRC development in a large study involving 2011 individuals. The study based on the Colorectal Cancer Study of Austria (CORSA), including 384 CRC cases as well as age- and gender-matched 544 high-risk adenomas, 537 low-risk adenoma patients and 546 colonoscopy-negative controls.

A wide range of technologies have been used for the diagnosis of TB. However, current diagnostic tests are inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of four genes, namely ASUN, NEMF, PTPRC and DHX29 as candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis of Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and active TB and discrimination of active TB and LTBI. ; Materials and Methods: The expression of the mentioned four genes as well as ACTB as a housekeeping gene was evaluated by real-time PCR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to assess the specificity and sensitivity of each validated biomarker. ; Results: Our results showed that the expression of theASUN gene could discriminate between active TB cases and healthy BCG vaccinated volunteers with an AUC value of 0.76, combing with a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 67%. It should be noted that the PTPRC gene also has the potential for the diagnosis of active TB with an AUC value of 0.67 and a sensitivity of 64.5% and a specificity of 70%. The curve revealed that cases with LTBI could be distinguished from healthy BCG vaccinated volunteers according to their expression of the ASUN gene with an AUC value of 0.81. The cut-off value for diagnosing was 11, with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 79%. Moreover, the expression of the NEMF gene might be considered as a diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of LTBI. The analysis showed an AUC value of 0.75. The highest sensitivity (60%) and specificity (81%) were obtained with a cut off value of 12. ; Conclusion: According to our results, the expression of ASUN and NEMF genes might be considered as a diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of LTBI. Our study showed that the expression of ASUN and PTPRC was obviously higher in active TB patients than those in healthy BCG vaccinated controls. On the other hand, DHX29 and PTPRC genes might be helpful in differentiating active TB and LTBI.

39745212,[Investigation of Resistance Nodulation Division (RND) Efflux Pump and OPRD Expression Levels in Antibiotic Resistance of Clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolates].,"Kürkçü Muhammed Furkan, Fatsa Tuğba, Tanriverdi Elif Seren, Karakuş Hasan, Hoşbul Tuğrul, Otlu Barış","The increasing antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, responsible for both community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections, is of global significance. The primary mechanisms contributing to resistance development in P.aeruginosa include the increased activity of efflux pumps, decreased permeability of outer membrane porins and the production of carbapenemases. This study aimed to determine the effects of resistance nodulation division (RND) efflux pumps, outer membrane porin D (OprD) outer membrane protein and carbapenemase production on the development of resistance to different antibiotics in P.aeruginosa isolates. Eighty P.aeruginosa isolates obtained from clinical samples in our hospital between 2019 and 2021 were included in the study. Species-level identification of the isolates was performed using MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using the VITEK® 2 (bioMérieux, France) system according to the criteria of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). The expression levels of the outer membrane porin protein OprD and the regulatory genes of efflux pumps (mexB, mexC, mexE, and mexX) were investigated using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Rt-qPCR). The rpsL gene was used as the reference gene and P.aeruginosa PAO1 strain was used as the control strain in Rt-qPCR. Comparative expression analysis was calculated using the delta-delta cycle threshold (ΔΔCt) method. The presence of blaOXA-48, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaKPC and blaOXA-10 was investigated by PCR. Clonal relationships among the isolates were determined by AP-PCR using the M13 primer. Band profiles were analyzed using GelCompar II (Applied Maths) software. Decreased OprD expression was detected in 63.7% of the isolates and 74% of carbapenem-resistant isolates. The decrease in OprD expression was found to be significant only between the carbapenem-susceptible (n= 30) and carbapenem-resistant (n= 50) groups (p= 0.014). The overexpression rate of mexB was 82% in carbapenem-resistant isolates and 33% in carbapenem-susceptible isolates; 76.6% in multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates and 45.5% in non-MDR isolates (p= 0.001 and p= 0.004, respectively). The overexpression rate of mexX was 68% and 40% in the amikacin-resistant and susceptible groups, respectively; and 64.3% and 40.4% in the gentamicin-resistant and susceptible groups, respectively (p= 0.02 and p= 0.041, respectively). Overexpression of mexX was found in 61.7% of MDR isolates and 30.3% of non-MDR isolates (p= 0.006). No significant difference was found in the expression of mexC and mexE between antibiotic-susceptible and resistant groups. While blaOXA-10 was detected in 32% (16/50) of carbapenem-resistant isolates, blaOXA-48, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaKPC were not detected in any of the isolates. AP-PCR analysis identified 64 different genotypes and no dominant genotype was observed. The isolates were grouped into 14 different clusters with a clustering rate of 36%. RND efflux systems play a crucial role in the development of antibiotic resistance in P.aeruginosa. This study showed that overexpression of mexB and decreased expression of OprD contributed to the development of carbapenem resistance, while overexpression of mexX contributed to the development of amikacin and gentamicin resistance. Overexpression of mexB and mexX has significant correlation with MDR isolates. The detection of blaOXA-10 in 16 isolates suggests that the presence of this resistance gene may contribute to the development of carbapenem resistance.",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,2024.0,Turkey,10.5578/mb.20249666,"English Abstract, Journal Article","Porins, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Humans, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Microbial Sensitivity Tests, Bacterial Proteins, Pseudomonas Infections, Membrane Transport Proteins, Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins, beta-Lactamases, Drug Resistance, Bacterial",,"[MALDI-TOF MS, VITEK® 2 system, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Rt-qPCR), delta-delta cycle threshold (ΔΔCt) method, PCR, AP-PCR, GelCompar II software, RND efflux systems, mexB, mexC, mexE, mexX, OprD, outer membrane porins, carbapenemases, blaOXA-48, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaKPC, blaOXA-10, clonal relationships, genotypes, clusters.","[Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P.aeruginosa PAO1 strain, Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates]

Hypoxia, a major factor in the tumor microenvironment, results from the high metabolic rate of tumor cells and inadequate vascularization, impairing immune cells' function and potentially influencing gene expression profiles. Despite the widespread use of quantitative real-time PCR in immunological studies, to the best of our knowledge, data on reference gene stability in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells under hypoxic conditions is limited. In our study, we assessed the expression stability of commonly used reference genes (<i>S18</i>, <i>HPRT</i>, <i>IPO8</i>, <i>RPL13A</i>, <i>SDHA</i>, <i>PPIA</i>, and <i>UBE2D2</i>) in both non-stimulated and CD3/CD28-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured under normoxic, hypoxic (1% O<sub>2</sub>), and chemically induced hypoxic conditions for 24 h. Analysis using four different algorithms-delta Ct, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper-identified <i>RPL13A</i>, <i>S18</i>, and <i>SDHA</i> as the most suitable reference genes for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells under hypoxic conditions.

However, RG expression may be affected by age or overall health and most studies use only male animals. We investigated whether expression of common RGs (Gapdh, Gusb, Rplp0, B2m, Tubb5, Rpl7l1, Hprt, Rer1) was affected by age, sex and/or overall health (frailty index) in skeletal muscle from young (4-mos) and aged (25-26-mos) mice. Standard RG selection programs recommended Gapdh (RefFinder/Genorm/NormFinder) or Rpl7l1 (BestKeeper) without considering age and sex. Analysis of raw Cq values showed only Rplp0 was stable in both sexes at both ages. When qPCR data were normalised to Rplp0, age affected RG expression, especially in females. For example, Hprt expression declined with age (Hprt=9.8 ×10<sup>-2</sup> ± 4.7 ×10<sup>-2</sup> vs. 6.5 ×10<sup>-3</sup> ± 8.8 ×10<sup>-4</sup>; mean±SEM), while Gusb expression increased (6.0 ×10<sup>-4</sup> ± 5.5 ×10<sup>-5</sup> vs. 1.7 ×10<sup>-3</sup> ± 3.1 ×10<sup>-4</sup>; n = 5/group; p < 0.05). These effects were not seen in males. Tubb5 and Gapdh were not affected by age or sex when normalised to Rplp0. Similar results were seen with normalisation by Gapdh or the Rplp0/Gapdh pair.

The determination of anthocyanin synthesis-related enzyme gene sequences and the selection of appropriate reference genes provide a basis for analyzing the functional properties of anthocyanins. In this study, four dominant subtropical forest species (i.e., Schima superba, Castanopsis fissa, Acmena acuminatissima, Cryptocarya concinna) were taken as materials. To obtain the correct nucleotide sequences of anthocyanin-related enzymes, the nucleotide sequences of CHS, DFR and ANS in each dominant species were obtained by sequencing and comparison. Then, to select the most stable reference genes for leaves at different developmental stages and different light conditions, the expression levels of six reference genes, including 18S, Actin, GAPDH, TUB, EF1 and UBQ, were studied by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), and reference gene stability was analyzed by GeNorm and NormFinder software. The results showed that the expression level of Actin was the most stable in S. superba, A. acuminatissima and C. concinna, and the expression level of GAPDH was the most stable in C. fissa. Finally, the expression levels of the anthocyanin synthesis genes CHS, DFR and ANS were analyzed and found to be consistent with the accumulation trend of anthocyanins in leaves.

Hack.) is a species originating in China and is an excellent warm-season turfgrass. As a native species in southern China, it is naturally distributed in the phosphorus-deficient and aluminum-toxic acid soil areas. It is important to research the molecular mechanism of centipedegrass responses to phosphorus-deficiency and/or aluminum-toxicity stress. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a common method for gene expression analysis, and the accuracy of qRT-PCR results depends heavily on the stability of internal reference genes. However, there are still no reported stable and effective reference genes for qRT-PCR analysis of target genes under the acid-soil-related stresses in different organs of centipedegrass. For scientific rigor, the gene used as a reference for any plant species and/or any stress conditions should be first systematically screened and evaluated. This study is the first to provide a group of reliable reference genes to quantify the expression levels of functional genes of <i>Eremochloa ophiuroides</i> under multiple stresses of P deficiency and/or aluminum toxicity. In this study, centipedegrass seedlings of the acid-soil-resistant strain 'E041' and acid-soil-sensitive strain 'E089' were used for qRT-PCR analysis. A total of 11 candidate reference genes (<i>ACT</i>, <i>TUB</i>, <i>GAPDH</i>, <i>TIP41</i>, <i>CACS</i>, <i>HNR</i>, <i>EP</i>, <i>EF1α</i>, <i>EIF4α</i>, <i>PP2A</i> and <i>actin</i>) were detected by qRT-PCR technology, and the stability of candidate genes was evaluated with the combination of four internal stability analysis software programs.

In addition, for different tissues under various stresses, the selected reference genes were also different. <i>CACS</i> and <i>PP2A</i> were identified as two stable reference genes in roots through all three stress treatments (phosphate deficiency, aluminum toxicity, and the multiple stress treatment of aluminum toxicity and phosphate deficiency). Moreover, <i>CACS</i> was also stable as a reference gene in roots under each treatment (phosphate deficiency, aluminum toxicity, or multiple stresses of aluminum toxicity and phosphate deficiency). In stems under all three stress treatments, <i>GAPDH</i> and <i>EIF4α</i> were the most stable reference genes; for leaves, <i>PP2A</i> and <i>TIP41</i> showed the two highest rankings in all three stress treatments. Finally, qRT-PCR analysis of the expression patterns of the target gene <i>ALMT1</i> was performed to verify the selected reference genes.

The hallmarks of progressive CAD are interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA). MicroRNAs are small, regulatory RNAs involved in many immunological processes. In particular, microRNA-21-5p (miR-21) is considered to be strongly associated with pathogenesis regarding tubulointerstitium. The aim of this study was to assess urinary miR-21 expression levels in the kidney transplant recipients and determine their application in the evaluation of IFTA and kidney allograft function.

34933714,Evaluation of serum zinc level and IL-18 mRNA expression in children with pneumonia.,"Yang Shixiong, Shi Jin","Pneumonia is currently one of the leading causes of death in children. Increased susceptibility to pneumonia may be due to their decreased immunity. One of the reasons for the decrease in immunity is zinc deficiency. In children with pneumonia, on the other hand, some cytokines are secreted, resulting in inflammation that spreads, persists, and makes treatment difficult for specialists. In this study, we investigated the serum zinc level in children with pneumonia and healthy children. Also, we tried to find its relationship with IL-18 mRNA expression as an inflammatory cytokine. For this purpose, serum zinc levels and IL-18 mRNA expression were evaluated in 120 children aged 3-60 months with pneumonia and 120 healthy children. After taking 2ml of blood from children and measuring serum zinc level, the level of the IL-18 mRNA was measured by real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted by bioZOL™-G RNA Isolation Reagent kit. The primary cDNA was amplified by the extracted RNA, and in the next step, 2µl of cDNA were amplified by specific primers to measure IL-18 mRNA. The Beta-actin gene was also used as internal control and housekeeping gene. Results showed that the level of zinc in the patient group was 412.625±28.87?M and in the control group was 514.40±49.67?M. This difference was statistically significant (P=0.0053). Also, the expression of the IL-18 gene was increased in children with pneumonia, significantly (P=0.0015). Therefore, from the results, it can be deduced that children with zinc deficiency were at higher risk for a lung infection. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-18 also were increased in these children. Hence, it can be concluded that zinc levels can reduce the expression of IL-18 mRNA and play an important role in the prevention and treatment of children with pneumonia.","Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",2021.0,France,10.14715/cmb/2021.67.3.26,Journal Article,"Case-Control Studies, Child, Preschool, Female, Gene Expression, Humans, Infant, Interleukin-18, Male, Pneumonia, RNA, Messenger, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Zinc",,"[real-time PCR, BioZOL™-G RNA Isolation Reagent kit, specific primers, Beta-actin gene]","[Human children]

Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the three sheep had the closest genetic relationship with Capra hircus and the furthest genetic relationship with Cervus canadensis.The secondary structure of KAP24.1 was mainly composed of random coil.PEGFP-N1-KAP24.1 was successfully constructed eukaryotic recombinant expression plasmid was successfully transfected into HeLa cells to obtain 58 kDa KAP24.1 recombinant protein. When the concentration of androgen is 10<sup>-8</sup> mol / L, the protein expression is the highest. The expression of KAP24.1 gene in skin and hair follicles of Mountain-type Hetian sheep was significantly different from that of plain-type Hetian sheep (P < 0.05), and there was significant difference between Mountain-type Hetian sheep and Karakul Sheep (P < 0.05). The expression of Karakul Sheep was significantly higher than that of Plain-type Hetian sheep (P < 0.05). The 759 bp CDS sequence of KAP24.1 gene in sheep was cloned, and PEGFP-N1-KAP24.1 was constructed eukaryotic recombinant expression plasmid to obtain 58 kDa KAP24.1 recombinant protein. When the concentration of androgen was 10<sup>-8</sup>mol / L, the protein expression was the highest, and KAP24.1 gene was expressed in the skin and hair follicles of three sheep breeds, and the expression of Mountain-type Hetian sheep was the highest.",Gene,2023.0,Netherlands,10.1016/j.gene.2023.147591,Journal Article,"Humans, Sheep, Animals, Androgens, Phylogeny, HeLa Cells, Sheep, Domestic, Gene Expression, Recombinant Proteins","Androgen, Eukaryotic expression, Hetian sheep, KAP24.1 gene, Karakul Sheep","PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), cloning (plasmid construction), double digestion, sequencing, sequence analysis, SDS-PAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis), Western blotting, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR, phylogenetic tree analysis, secondary structure prediction.","[Plain-type Hetian sheep, Mountain-type Hetian sheep, Karakul sheep, Capra hircus, Cervus canadensis, Hela cells]"
