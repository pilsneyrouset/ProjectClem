Yalda, ","Nowadays, with the continuously increasing advances in understanding cancer  system  biology.It  has  led  to  the  discovery  of  valuable disease-specific  biomarkers.  Bytargeting  these  markers  using molecular-basedtechniques a highly specific and sensitive measurements can be obtained. Molecular  diagnosis  through  PCR-based  methods  and  next-generation sequencing  (NGS)  can  detect  many  diseases  caused  by  DNA  and  RNA changes that cannot be detected through antibody-based techniques. RT-qPCR   isa   valuable   tool   in   measuring biomarker’stranscriptional signature  and  will  have  a  great potentialin personalized  medicine  or molecular  diagnostics.  In  related  gene  expression  analysis,  using a suitable  reference  gene  is  crucial  for  the  accurate  interpretation  of  the results. For this reason, ref. gene should be validated for particular tissue, cell and experimental conditions.  This  study was conducted to identify and validate the most suitable housekeeping gene(HKG)as a reference(ref.)gene  to  obtain  accurate  normalization  for AXL  receptor  tyrosine kinasegene expression in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded “FFPE” of breast  cancer  tissues.  Based  on  the  five  different  statistical  algorithms used, ACTB was the least variable ref. gene and -GLOBIN showed the highest  variability. Norm  finder, Best  Keeper  and  the  comparative ΔCt method  suggested  to  use  ACTB  as  a  ref.  gene  in  our  experiment  while geNorm suggested to use the combination of both ACTB and UBC since they   had   the   same   exact   stability   value.   In   conclusion,   Reffinder suggested that ACTB had the least geomean of ranking values of the four used methods showing the least variance among the other genes and the three groups of our samples.",Al-Nahrain Journal of Science,2024

To achieve reliable results by RT-qPCR, the most stable reference genes must be selected for proper data normalisation, particularly when comparing cells of different types. We aimed to choose the least variable candidate reference genes among eight housekeeping genes tested within a set of human cancer cell lines (HeLa, MCF-7, SK-UT-1B, A549, A431, SK-BR-3), as well as four lines of normal, non-malignant mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of different origins. Methods: The reference gene stability was evaluated using four algorithms (BestKeeper, NormFinder, geNorm and the comparative ΔCt method) and ranked with the RefFinder web-based tool. Results: We found increased variability in the housekeeping genes’ expression in the cancer cell lines compared to that in normal MSCs. POP4 and GAPDH were identified as the most suitable reference genes in cancer cells, while 18S and B2M were the most suitable in MSCs. POP4 and EIF2B1 were shown to be the least variable genes when analysing normal and cancer cell lines together. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mRNA relative expression was normalised by the three most stable or three least stable reference genes to demonstrate the reliability of reference genes validation. Conclusion: We analysed and selected stable reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis in the wide panel of cancer cell lines and MSCs. The study provides a reliable tool for future research concerning the expression of genes involved in various intracellular signalling pathways and emphasises the need for careful selection of suitable references before analysing target gene expression.",Frontiers in Bioscience-Scholar,2024

In order to screen for suitable reference genes under high-temperature stress conditions in Arabidopsis, this study measured the relative expression levels of 17 candidate reference genes using qRT-PCR. Among these, four are traditional reference genes, while the remaining thirteen are candidate reference genes with no previous reports on their use as reference genes. The expression stability of the candidate reference gene expression was analyzed and evaluated using five methods: ΔCt, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. The results indicated that the LHCB4.1 and LHCB5 genes displayed the highest stability in expression under high-temperature stress conditions. To verify the stability of the reference genes, we treated Arabidopsis with high-temperature stress, used the selected LHCB4.1 and LHCB5 as references, and analyzed the expression of the heat-responsive gene HSFA2 using qRT-PCR. The results showed that when LHCB4.1 and LHCB5 were used individually or in combination as reference genes, the relative expression of HSFA2 significantly increased and remained consistent under high-temperature treatment. This indicates that both LHCB4.1 and LHCB5 are suitable reference genes for qRT-PCR analysis in Arabidopsis exposed to high-temperature stress. The novel reference genes identified in this study will serve as a reliable reference standard for gene expression studies in Arabidopsis under high-temperature stress, thereby enhancing the accuracy and comparability of experimental data.",Current Issues in Molecular Biology,2024

To address this challenge, we established brain (CAB) and kidney (CAK) cell lines in our laboratory previously, providing a valuable tool for in vitro studies on immune responses. In this study, we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to identify the optimal reference gene from six reference genes for CAB and CAK cells, under both normal conditions and after stimulation with LPS or Poly I: C. The qRT-PCR data were analyzed using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software (Version 3.5) to ensure comprehensve evaluation. The results showed that RPL13 was the most stable reference gene for both CAB and CAK cells under normal conditions. Following LPS stimulation, TTLL1 was the best reference gene for CAB cells, while RPL13 remained the most suitable for CAK cells. For Poly I: C stimulation, EF1A and Actin were identified as the most stable reference genes for CAB and CAK cells, respectively. To confirm the reliability of the selected reference genes, we analyzed the expression of the cytokine genes IL-6 and IFN-h, demonstrating the dependability of these reference genes. This study lays a solid foundation for exploring gene expression patterns in humpback grouper cell lines under various experimental conditions, providing essential insights for future research into immune processes and disease control strategies in aquaculture.",Fishes,2024

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying its interactions with host pests remain unclear. Screening for optimal reference genes is a prerequisite for using reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to investigate the interrelationship. Here, ten commonly used reference genes (Act, GAPDH, β-Tub, EF1-α, RPS10, RPS15, RPL6, RPL13, RPL32, and HSP90) were selected, and their expression stability across developmental stages, tissues, temperatures, and host conditions were evaluated using RefFinder, which uses multiple analytical approaches (NormFinder, geNorm, the ΔCt method, and BestKeeper). The findings suggested that the most reliable normalization can be achieved by selecting the two reference genes for all conditions, with the optimal pairs being RPS10 and RPL32 for the developmental stage, RPS10 and RPS15 for tissue, RPS10 and RPS15 for the host, and EF1-α and RPL13 for temperature. Also, the best and least stable reference genes were chosen to compare the relative transcript levels of the TBX1 in various tissues, which exhibited considerable variation. Our findings will significantly enhance the reliability of RT-qPCR and provide a foundation for further research on the expression patterns of crucial genes that are implicated in the interaction between O. nagaii and its host pests.",Insects,2024

                Background
                Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) is a vital cereal crop, predominantly cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It serves as a staple food for millions, while also being utilized as forage and an energy crop. The crop’s resistance to heat and drought, coupled with its high biomass, positions it as a promising candidate for climate-resilient agriculture. A detailed understanding of its gene expression patterns across various tissues and developmental stages is essential for enhancing its yield and quality. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by employing RNA-seq to identify housekeeping genes (HKGs) and tissue-specific genes (TSGs) in pearl millet.
              
                Results
                Our analysis of RNA-seq data from nine tissues (seed, germ, radicle, leaf, root, tillering tissue, stem, spike, and grain) across eight developmental stages in pearl millet accession Tifleaf3 revealed a comprehensive gene expression profile. We identified 461 HKGs that exhibited stable expression across all tissues and stages, providing robust internal references for RT-qPCR. Additionally, 8091 TSGs were discovered, many of which showed distinctive expression patterns in tissues such as spike, stem, and leaf. Functional enrichment analysis of these genes using GO and KEGG pathways highlighted their roles in key biological processes and pathways, indicating their potential in crop trait enhancement. Protein-protein interaction networks constructed for stem and leaf tissues further illuminated the regulatory mechanisms underlying the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth stages.
              
                Conclusion
                This study presents a detailed transcriptomic landscape of pearl millet, identifying a set of HKGs and TSGs that are crucial for understanding the molecular basis of its growth and development. We provided valuable options for transcript normalization and crucial targets for exploring gene function for the plant growth and development in pearl millet. The insights gained from this work are instrumental for breeding programs aimed at enhancing the productivity of pearl millet, thereby contributing to food and energy security.

                  Objective
                  The choice of a stable reference gene plays a crucial role in gene expression analysis. In most cases, the choice of housekeeping gene (HKG) is quite random. However, the expression of HKGs varies under different experimental conditions and in different tissues.
               
               
                  Methods
                  The study focused on three reference genes in Catla Labeo catla—beta actin (β-actin), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1α)—under four experimental conditions: bacterial challenge, hypoxia, a combination of bacterial challenge and hypoxia, and control. The fish were subjected to the above-mentioned experimental circumstances, and five tissues (blood, gill, liver, kidney, and spleen) were collected at regular intervals.
               
               
                  Result
                  The investigation of gene expression in the five tissues was performed using real-time (RT) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and the resultant cycle threshold values were subjected to several statistical techniques via the RefFinder tool to determine the most stable HKG. The results were ordered in accordance with the stability of the reference genes. In this study, GAPDH was found to be the least stable gene, while β-actin and EF-1α remained stable in the kidney and liver under various circumstances. Other tissues demonstrated tissue- and treatment-specific stability for the various HKGs.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  The findings indicate that GAPDH should be avoided in Catla for gene expression studies and that different algorithms should be employed to validate the stability of HKGs in RT-qPCR analysis.

                Background
                Kobreisa littledalei, belonging to the Cyperaceae family is the first Kobresia species with a reference genome and the most dominant species in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau alpine meadows. It has several resistance genes which could be used to breed improved crop varieties. Reverse Transcription Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) is a popular and accurate gene expression analysis method. Its reliability depends on the expression levels of reference genes, which vary by species, tissues and environments. However, K.littledalei lacks a stable and normalized reference gene for RT-qPCR analysis.
              
                Results
                The stability of 13 potential reference genes was tested and the stable reference genes were selected for RT-qPCR normalization for the expression analysis in the different tissues of K. littledalei under two abiotic stresses (salt and drought) and two hormonal treatments (abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA)). Five algorithms were used to assess the stability of putative reference genes. The results showed a variation amongst the methods, and the same reference genes showed tissue expression differences under the same conditions. The stability of combining two reference genes was better than a single one. The expression levels of ACTIN were stable in leaves and stems under normal conditions, in leaves under drought stress and in roots under ABA treatment. The expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression was stable in the roots under the control conditions and salt stress and in stems exposed to drought stress. Expression levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were stable in stems of ABA-treated plants and in the roots under drought stress. Moreover, RPL6 expression was stable in the leaves and stems under salt stress and in the stems of the GA-treated plants. EF1-alpha expression was stable in leaves under ABA and GA treatments. The expression levels of 28 S were stable in the roots under GA treatment. In general, ACTIN and GAPDH could be employed as housekeeping genes for K. littledalei under different treatments.

                This study identified the best RT-qPCR reference genes for different K. littledalei tissues under five experimental conditions. ACTIN and GAPDH genes can be employed as the ideal housekeeping genes for expression analysis under different conditions. This is the first study to investigate the stable reference genes for normalized gene expression analysis of K. littledalei under different conditions. The results could aid molecular biology and gene function research on Kobresia and other related species.

The findings of this research demonstrated that, although the stability of three reference genes expression was acceptable in almost all evaluated treatments, fluctuations in their expression were observed under the treatments of cold stress with TiO2 NPs application, cold plasma application with salinity stress, and cold plasma application with high-temperature stress compared to others. Simultaneously, the GeNorm analysis results demonstrated that in the mentioned treatments, relying on only one reference gene is inadequate. To corroborate the results, we examined the expression profile of the SSR gene, a pivotal gene in diosgenin biosynthesis, under all investigated treatments and treatment combinations. The outcomes suggested that employing stable reference genes yielded highly consistent results.
              
                Conclusions
                The varying expression patterns of the target genes emphasize the crucial need for precise optimization of experimental conditions and selecting stable reference genes to achieve accurate results in gene expression studies utilizing real-time PCR. These findings offer valuable insights into the selection of appropriate reference genes for gene expression analysis under diverse conditions using real-time PCR.

Wilson, Anne Hege Alm-Kristiansen","Abstract
          
            Background
            Reliable RT-qPCR results are dependent on appropriate normalisation. Oocyte maturation studies can be challenging in this respect, as the stage of development can distinctively affect reference gene transcript abundance. The aim of this study was to validate the use of reference genes in oocyte in vitro maturation RT-qPCR studies, and thereafter, examine the abundance of transcripts supporting histone modification during oocyte and early embryo development in oocytes of contrasting quality.
          
          
            Methods and results
            Total RNA from oocytes from prepubertal gilts and sows was extracted either directly succeeding follicle aspiration or after 44 h in vitro maturation, followed by RT-qPCR. The stability of YWHAG, HPRT1, ACTB, GAPDH, HMBS and PFKP, was analysed by NormFinder and further cross-validated by assessing results generated following application of different combinations of potential reference genes for normalisation of the RT-qPCR data. Combining ACTB and PFKP generated high stability according to NormFinder and concordant results. Applying this normalisation, gilt derived oocytes displayed significantly higher abundance than oocytes from sows of almost all the epigenetic-related transcripts studied (HDAC2, SIRT1, SALL4, KDM1A, KDM1B, KDM5A), both before and after maturation.
          
          
            Conclusions
            This study identified the combined use of ACTB and PFKP as the optimal normalisation for porcine oocyte RT-qPCR data. In oocytes collected from prepubertal gilts, transcription did not appear to be silenced at the time of aspiration, and accumulation of transcripts supporting histone modification facilitating proper fertilization and further embryo development seemed delayed. The results imply the epigenetic-related transcripts may have potential as markers of oocyte quality.

Furthermore, this bacterium can survive in extreme environmental conditions, which makes it a frequent cause of nosocomial infection outbreaks. Gene expression analyses by Reverse Transcription Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) depend on a reference gene, also called an endogenous gene, which is used to normalize the generated data and thus ensure an accurate analysis with minimal errors. Currently, gene expression analyses in A. baumannii are compromised, as there are no reports in the literature describing the identification of validated reference genes for use in RT-qPCR analyses. For this reason, we selected twelve candidate reference genes of A. baumannii and assessed their expression profile under different experimental and culture conditions. The expression stability of the candidate genes was evaluated by using statistical algorithms such as BestKeeper, geNorm, NormFinder, Delta CT, and RefFinder, in order to identify the most suitable candidate reference genes for RT-qPCR analyses. The statistical analyses indicated rpoB, rpoD, and fabD genes as the most adequate to ensure accurate normalization of RT-qPCR data in A. baumannii. The accuracy of the proposed reference genes was validated by using them to normalize the expression of the ompA gene, encoding the outer membrane protein A, in A. baumannii sensible and resistant to the antibiotic polymyxin. The present work provides suitable reference genes for precise RT-qPCR data normalization on future gene expression studies with A. baumannii.",Scientific Reports,2024

However, the use of RT-qPCR for gene expression analysis can be affected by factors that directly affect the reliability of the results. Among these factors, the appropriate choice of reference genes is crucial and can strongly impact RT-qPCR relative gene expression analyses, highlighting the importance in correctly choosing the most suitable genes for the success of the analysis. Thus, this study aimed to select and validate reference genes for relative gene expression studies through RT-qPCR in hybrids of Eucalyptus tereticornis × Eucalyptus camaldulensis (drought tolerant and susceptible to Leptocybe invasa) under conditions of inoculation by the Beauveria bassiana fungus and subsequent infestation by L. invasa. The expression level and stability of eleven candidate genes were evaluated. Stability was analyzed using the RefFinder tool, which integrates the geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and Delta-Ct algorithms. The selected reference genes were validated through the expression analysis of the transcriptional factor EcDREB2 (dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2). For all treatments evaluated, EcPTB, EcPP2A-1, and EcEUC12 were the best reference genes. The triplets EcPTB/EcEUC12/EcUBP6, EcPP2A-1/EcEUC12/EcPTB, EcIDH/EcSAND/Ecα-TUB, EcPP2A-1/Ecα-TUB/EcPTB, and EcPP2A-1/EcUPL7/EcSAND were the best reference genes for the control plants, mother plants, plants inoculated with B. bassiana, plants infested with L. invasa, and plants inoculated with B. bassiana and subsequently infested with L. invasa, respectively. The best determined reference genes were used to normalize the RT-qPCR expression data for each experimental condition evaluated.

          Microglia represent the primary immune defense system within the central nervous system and play a role in the inflammatory processes occurring in numerous disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD onset and progression are associated with factors considered possible causes of neuroinflammation, i.e. genetic mutations. In vitro models of microglial cells were established to identify specific molecular targets in PD through the analysis of gene expression data. Recently, the Human Microglial Clone 3 cell line (HMC3) has been characterized and a new human microglia model has emerged. Here we perform RT-qPCR analyses to evaluate the expression of ten reference genes in HMC3, untreated or stimulated to a pro-inflammatory status. The comparative ∆CT method, BestKeeper, Normfinder, geNorm and RefFinder algorithms were used to assess the stability of the candidate genes. The results showed that the most suitable internal controls are HPRT1, RPS18 and B2M genes. In addition, the most stable and unstable reference genes were used to normalize the expression of a gene of interest in HMC3, resulting in a difference in the statistical significance in cells treated with Rotenone. This is the first reference gene validation study in HMC3 cell line in pro-inflammatory status and can contribute to more reliable gene expression analysis in the field of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory research.",Scientific Reports,2024

The gene expression profiles of neutrophils from different tumor types are of great interest. Murine splenic neutrophils reflect the immune status of the organism and could be a source of tumor-associated neutrophils in tumor-bearing mice. However, information about appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis of murine neutrophils in the literature is lacking. The aim of this study was to identify stably expressed reference genes in murine splenic neutrophils. Methods: Bone marrow- and spleen-derived neutrophils were isolated from healthy C57Bl/6 and CBA/LacSto mice. Spleen-derived neutrophils were isolated from mice with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and drug-resistant lymphosarcoma (RLS40). RNA was isolated and used for RT-qPCR analysis of 10 selected reference genes. Analysis of reference gene stability was performed using four different algorithms (BestKeeper, NormFinder, geNorm, ΔCt method), and comprehensive ranking was constructed using RefFinder. Results: The Ct values for the reference genes were in the range of 16.73–30.83 with the highest expression levels observed for B2m and the lowest for Sdha. Differences in the stability ranking performed by different algorithms were observed; however, the overall ranking of the studied reference genes was as follows, from most to least stably expressed: Tbp, Hprt1, Ywhaz, B2m, Gapdh, Actb, Sdha, Eef2, Rack1, and Rpl13a. Using Tbp or Rpl13a for RT-qPCR data normalization significantly affected the interpretation of target gene expression.

Analyzing the expression of genes related to MUFA biosynthesis is essential for understanding the complex regulatory networks in Macadamia. However, there are few reports on the identification of suitable reference genes for use as internal controls in this species. Consequently, selecting a reliable reference gene for gene expression studies under various conditions is critical. In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of 11 traditional housekeeping genes: α-tubulin (TUBa), β-tubulin (TUBb), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), 18S ribosomal RNA (18S), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), α-elongation factor 1 (EF1a), β-elongation factor 1 (EF1b), ubiquitin (UBQ), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC), cyclophilin (CYP), and actin (ACT) under abiotic stresses, hormonal treatments and in variety of plant tissues using the online tool RefFinder, which integrates four commonly used software programs: ΔCt, geNorm (version 3.4), NormFinder (version 0953), and BestKeeper (version 1.0). A comprehensive expression stability ranking was established by integrating results from these four methods based on the geometric mean. The findings indicated that ACT was the most stable gene across all samples, including those subjected to cold stress, NaCl stress, PEG stress, ABA treatment, MeJA treatment, and both stem and leaf tissues. EF1b was identified as the most stable gene in GA treatment and heat stress samples, while UBC and CYP were ranked highest in ethrel treatment and root tissue samples, respectively.

This dual temperature adaptability necessitates establishing both temperature conditions in research to examine the effects on various biological processes. In quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays, the selection of appropriate housekeeping genes is vital for data accuracy. Nevertheless, the lack of alternatives and information often leads to the default use of the 16S rRNA gene despite potential limitations. This investigation sourced 16 potential reference genes through a comprehensive review of the literature and transcriptome sequencing data analysis. We validated the expression stability of these genes via qRT-PCR across 12

Methods and Results: To ensure the accuracy of qRT-PCR, selecting appropriate reference genes for quantifying target gene expression levels is essential. This study aims to identify stable reference genes during the development of L. discolor. In this study, the entire floral buds, including the lips and gynostemium from different development stages, were taken as materials. Based upon the transcriptome information of L. discolor, nine housekeeping genes, ACT, HIS, EF1-α1, EF1-α2, PP2A, UBQ1, UBQ2, UBQ3, and TUB, were selected in this research study as prospect interior referral genes. The expression of these nine genes were found by RT-qPCR and afterwards comprehensively examined by four software options: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and ΔCt. The outcomes of the analysis showed that ACT was the most steady gene, which could be the most effective inner referral gene for the expression evaluation of flower advancement in L. discolor. Conclusions: The results of this study will contribute to the molecular biology research of flower development in L. discolor and closely related species.",Genes,2024

To date, no study results have identified the optimal reference genes for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) normalization in Dendrocalamus brandisii. qRT-PCR offers a highly accurate and effective approach to analyzing gene expression. However, the precision of the resulting quantitative data hinges on the correct choice of reference genes. Twenty-one potential reference genes were identified from the D. brandisii transcriptomes. Their expression in 23 samples, including 8 different tissue organs and 15 samples of D. brandisii under various treatment conditions, were evaluated through qRT-PCR. Subsequently, four software programs—Delta CT, geNorm, NormFinder, and RefFinder—were employed to compare their expression stability. The results revealed that the selection of optimal reference genes varied based on the particular organ and condition being examined. EF-1-α-2 consistently exhibits the most stable expression across diverse tissues, while ACTIN-1, TUBULIN-1, and EF-1-α-2 were the most consistent reference genes in roots, culms, and leaves under various treatments, respectively.

To our knowledge, the reference genes of C. sacchariphagus have not been screened or evaluated, which hinders the functional gene study. In the present study, the stability of seven reference genes (β-ACT, GAPDH, BTF3, 28S, RPL7, EF1α, and SDHA) was evaluated in C. sacchariphagus under different experimental conditions, including tissues (antenna, head, thorax, abdomen, leg, and wing), temperatures (4 °C, 25 °C, and 37 °C) and sexes (male and female), through RefFinder, which integrates four algorithms (Normfinder, BestKeeper, ΔCt method, and geNorm). The findings suggested that the combination of β-ACT and RPL7 is ideal to analyze gene expressions in different tissues and at distinct temperatures, and EF1α and SDHA were suitable reference genes for comparing gene expressions between sexes. Finally, the expression profiles of CsacPBP1 gene were evaluated, and the outcomes further confirm the importance of selecting fitting reference genes for normalization of qRT-PCR data.

W. Hildyard, Chavaunne T. Thorpe","Tendons are one of the major load-bearing tissues in the body; subjected to enormous peak stresses, and thus vulnerable to injury. Cellular responses to tendon injury are complex, involving inflammatory and repair components, with the latter employing both resident and recruited exogenous cell populations. Gene expression analyses are valuable tools for investigating tendon injury, allowing assessment of repair processes and pathological responses such as fibrosis, and permitting evaluation of therapeutic pharmacological interventions. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a commonly used approach for such studies, but data obtained by this method must be normalised to reference genes: genes known to be stably expressed between the experimental conditions investigated. Establishing suitable tendon injury reference genes is thus essential. Accordingly we investigated mRNA expression stability in a rat model of tendon injury, comparing both injured and uninjured tendons, and the effects of rapamycin treatment, at 1 and 3 weeks post injury. We used 11 candidate genes (18S, ACTB, AP3D1, B2M, CSNK2A2, GAPDH, HPRT1, PAK1IP1, RPL13a, SDHA, UBC) and assessed stability via four complementary algorithms (Bestkeeper, deltaCt, geNorm, Normfinder). Our results suggests that ACTB, CSNK2A2, HPRT1 and PAK1IP1 are all stably expressed in tendon, regardless of injury or drug treatment: any three of these would serve as universally suitable reference gene panel for normalizing qPCR expression data in the rat tendon injury model. We also reveal 18S, UBC, GAPDH, and SDHA as consistently poor scoring candidates (with the latter two exhibiting rapamycin- and injury-associated changes, respectively): these genes should be avoided.",PLOS ONE,2024

                  Background
                  The robustness and credibility of RT-qPCR results are critically dependent on the selection of suitable reference genes. However, the mineralization of the extracellular matrix can alter the intracellular tension and energy metabolism within cells, potentially impacting the expression of traditional reference genes, namely Actb and Gapdh.
               
               
                  Objective
                  To methodically identify appropriate reference genes for research focused on mouse cementoblast mineralization.
               
               
                  Materials and methods
                  Time-series transcriptomic data of mouse cementoblast mineralization were used. To ensure expression stability and medium to high expression levels, three specific criteria were applied to select potential reference genes. The expression stability of these genes was ranked based on the DI index (1/coefficient of variation) to identify the top six potential reference genes. RT-qPCR validation was performed on these top six candidates, comparing their performance against six previously used reference genes (Rpl22, Ppib, Gusb, Rplp0, Actb, and Gapdh). Cq values of these 12 genes were analyzed by RefFinder to get a stability ranking.
               
               
                  Results
                  A total of 4418 (12.27%) genes met the selection criteria. Among them, Rab5if, Chmp4b, Birc5, Pea15a, Nudc, Supt4a were identified as candidate reference genes. RefFinder analyses revealed that two candidates (Birc5 and Nudc) exhibited superior performance compared to previously used reference genes.
               
               
                  Limitations
                  RefFinder’s stability ranking does not consider the influence of primer efficiency.
               
               
                  Conclusions and implications
                  We propose Birc5 and Nudc as candidate reference genes for RT-qPCR studies investigating mouse cementoblast mineralization and cementum repair.

Our preliminary experiments showed that the photoperiod greatly influence the formation of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum root tubers. In this study, we examined the oscillation patterns and expression characteristics of COL genes in leaves of T. hemsleyanum under different photoperiod conditions. Six genes were selected as candidate reference genes for further analyses: (1) 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA); (2) α-tubulin (TUBA); (3) 30S ribosomal RNA (30S rRNA); (4) TATA binding protein (TBP); (5) elongation factor 1α (EF-1α); and (6) RNA polymerase II (RPII). The geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software programs were used to evaluate expression stability. Two ThCOL genes were screened in the T. hemsleyanum transcriptome library, and their expression patterns under different photoperiod conditions were analysed using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The genes EF-1α, TUBA, and 18S rRNA were used to analyse the expression profiles of CONSTANS genes (ThCOL4 and ThCOL5) under different photoperiods.

The selection of stably expressed reference genes is required for accurate normalization. The aim of this study was to identify the optimal reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization in various brain regions of rats at different stages of the lithium–pilocarpine model of acquired epilepsy. We tested the expression stability of nine housekeeping genes commonly used as reference genes in brain research: Actb, Gapdh, B2m, Rpl13a, Sdha, Ppia, Hprt1, Pgk1, and Ywhaz. Based on four standard algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and comparative delta-Ct), we found that after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, the stability of the tested reference genes varied significantly between brain regions and depended on time after epileptogenesis induction (3 and 7 days in the latent phase, and 2 months in the chronic phase of the model). Pgk1 and Ywhaz were the most stable, while Actb, Sdha, and B2m demonstrated the lowest stability in the analyzed brain areas. We revealed time- and region-specific changes in the mRNA expression of the housekeeping genes B2m, Actb, Sdha, Rpl13a, Gapdh, Hprt1, and Sdha. These changes were more pronounced in the hippocampal region during the latent phase of the model and are thought to be related to epileptogenesis. Thus, RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA expression in acquired epilepsy models requires careful selection of reference genes depending on the brain region and time of analysis. For the time course study of epileptogenesis in the rat lithium–pilocarpine model, we recommend the use of the Pgk1 and Ywhaz genes.",Biomedicines,2024

Although reverse transcription‐quantitative PCR (RT‐qPCR) is the most widely applied laboratory technique to evaluate gene expression, its applicability in EV research is challenged by the lack of universal and stably present reference genes (RGs). In this study, we identify, validate and establish SNRPG, OST4, TOMM7 and NOP10 as RGs for the normalization of EV‐associated genes by RT‐qPCR. We show the stable presence of SNRPG, OST4, TOMM7 and NOP10 in multiple cell lines and their secreted EVs (n = 12) under different (patho)physiological conditions as well as in human‐derived biofluids (n = 3). Enzymatic treatments confirm the presence of SNRPG, OST4, TOMM7 and NOP10 inside EVs. In addition, the four EV‐associated RGs are stably detected in a size‐range of EV subpopulations.

               Rhyzopertha dominica is a serious stored grain insect pest around the world. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a widely used experimental method in molecular biology for detecting the expression of target genes. As appropriate reference genes are essential for normalizing gene expression, the selection of suitable reference genes is the basis of RT-qPCR experiments. In this study, the expression profiles of 7 candidate reference genes of rps3, rps6, rps13, actin, gadph, tubulin, and 18S rRNA were analyzed under 4 different experimental conditions. The expression stability of candidate genes was evaluated using the ΔCt, GeNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and RefFinder methods. The results revealed that different reference genes were suitable for various experiments. Specifically, rps3 and rps6 were appropriate for the developmental stages and all samples: 18S rRNA and rps13 for temperature-related experiments, actin and rps6 for sex-related experiments, and rps6 and gadph for starvation stress.

In practice, the evaluation of gene expression requires appropriate reference genes. To screen reliable reference genes for evaluating gene expression via qRT-PCR in Mythimna loreyi, a notorious migratory pest across Asia, Africa, Europe, and Australia, we assessed the expression stability of 13 candidate reference genes in M. loreyi using the ΔCt method, BestKeeper, Normfinder, GeNorm, and the web-based comprehensive platform RefFinder. These reference genes include RPL10, RPL27, RPL32, RPS3, TATA−box, GAPDH, AK, Actin, EF, α−tubulin, SOD, 18S rRNA, and FTZ−F1, which is frequently employed in Lepidoptera insects. Our findings revealed that the performance of the candidate reference gene depended on experimental conditions. Specifically, RPL27 and RPL10 were the most suitable for evaluating expression changes across developmental stages, tissues, and adult ages. The optimal reference genes were recommended in specific experiment conditions, for instance, EF and RPS3 were recommended for mating status, AK and RPL10 were recommended for temperature treatments, RPL27 and FTZ−F1 were recommended for larva diet, and EF and RPL27 were recommended for adult diet treatments. Additionally, expression profiles of pheromone-binding protein 2 (MlorPBP2) and glutathione S-transferase (MlorGST1) were used to validate the reference genes.

It is a major vector in transmitting plant viruses such as citrus yellow vein clearing virus (CYVCV), which has caused severe economic losses worldwide, and therefore efficient control of this pest is economically important. However, the scope of genetic studies primarily focused on D. citri is restricted, something that has potentially limited further study of efficient control options. To explore the functionalities of D. citri target genes, screening for specific reference genes using RT-qPCR under different experimental conditions is essential for the furtherance of biological studies concerning D. citri. The eight candidate reference genes were evaluated by dedicated algorithms (geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper and ΔCt method) under five specific experimental conditions (developmental stage, sex, tissue, population and temperature). In addition, the RefFinder software, a comprehensive evaluation platform integrating all of the above algorithms, ranked the expression stability of eight candidate reference genes. The results showed that the best reference genes under different experimental settings were V-ATP-A and RPS18 at different developmental stages; α-tubulin, 18S and V-ATP-A in both sexes; EF1A and α-tubulin in different tissues; Actin and Argk under different populations; and RPS18 and RPL13 in different temperatures. The validation of selected reference genes was further identified using heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 as a reporter gene. Our study, for the first time, provides a detailed compilation of internal reference genes for D. citri that are suitable for RT-qPCR analysis, which is robust groundwork for comprehensive investigation of the functional target genes of D. citri.",Genes,2024

Their expression stability was evaluated with five algorithms (Delta Ct, GeNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder) for sample types differing in response to five insecticide stresses and in four other experimental conditions. Our results indicated that the RGs RPL10 + RPS15 for Imidacloprid and Abamectin; RPL10 + AK for Thiamethoxam; RPL32 + RPL10 for λ-cyhalothrin; RPL10 + RPL8 for Matrine; and EF2 + RPL32 under different insecticide stresses were the most suitable RGs for RT-qPCR normalization.

The optimal reference gene/s for normalization should demonstrate stable expression across varying conditions to diminish potential influences on the results. Despite the extensive database available, research data are lacking regarding the most appropriate HKGs for qRT-PCR data analysis in rabbit and horse adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). Therefore, in our study, we comprehensively assessed and compared the suitability of some widely used HKGs, employing RefFinder and NormFinder, two extensively acknowledged algorithms for robust data interpretation. The rabbit and horse ASCs were obtained from subcutaneous stromal vascular fraction. ASCs were induced into tri-lineage differentiation, followed by the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment of the adipose-differentiated rabbit ASCs, while horse experimental groups were formed based on adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation. At the end of the experiment, the total mRNA was obtained and used for the gene expression evaluation of the observed factors. According to our findings, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was identified as the most appropriate endogenous control gene for rabbit ASCs, while hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase was deemed most suitable for horse ASCs. The obtained results underscore that these housekeeping genes exhibit robust stability across diverse experimental conditions, remaining unaltered by the treatments.

Identification and validation of reference genes for gene expression study using Quantitative Real-Time PCR in shallot (Allium cepa L. Aggregatum group) based on bulb development phase. Biodiversitas 25: 2645-2651. Shallot (Allium cepa L. Aggregatum group) is cultivated vegetatively using bulbs (produce many bulbs) and generatively using TSS (True Seed of Shallot) which tends to produce single bulbs. Bulb aggregation is influenced by activity of genes and the gene expression could be analyzed using quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The qRT-PCR analysis requires reference gene data (housekeeping gene) as a comparison gene against our target gene. This study aimed to select and validate three housekeeping genes in shallot as an initial study for qRT-PCR analysis. The research flow began with the preparation of shallot 'TukTuk' leaves and bulb samples in bulb formation from bulb initial phase to mature phase. Furthermore, a specific primer design based on actin, tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene sequences were obtained from gene bank data. The results showed that the actin, tubulin, and GAPDH genes were successfully amplified and the products were 142 bp, 116 bp, and 136 bp in size, respectively and the genes were expressed almost constantly in leaves and bulbs in all phases of bulb formation. The tubulin gene had the potential as a reference gene for qRT-PCR analysis in shallot with the most consistently expressed.",Biodiversitas Journal of Biological Diversity,2024
10.3389/finsc.2024.1362473,Identification of specific reference gene for normalization of RT-qPCR data in rhythmic gene expression studies of the effect of developmental hormone antagonist in postembryonic development in Bombyx mori,"Minurani Dalai, Anita Jagota","Bombyx mori is a lepidopteran holometabolous insect with distinct developmental stages: egg, larvae, pupae, and adult. The lepidopteran insect undergoes major modifications in the central nervous system (CNS) so as to adapt to the lifestyle of these distinct stages with specific habitats and functions from voraciously feeding larval stages to flying reproductive adults via dormant pupal stages. Such transitions are linked to transcriptional, epigenetic, and translational complexities. Therefore, studying rhythmic gene expression in CNS of various developmental stages and the effects of antagonists on developmental hormones requires a very stable reference gene (RG). To facilitate rhythmic gene expression studies using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in B. mori and the effect of developmental hormone juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxy ecdysone hormone (20 HE), antagonists Precocene 1 and testosterone, respectively, were used. Eight candidate RGs, namely, Translational initiation factor 3 subunit 4 (TI3S4), Translational initiation factor 3 subunit 5 (TI3S5), Ribosomal protein subunit 7 (RPs7), TATA-binding protein association factor (TAF13), Translational initiation factor 4 A (TI4A), Ribosomal protein (RPL32), Elongation factor 1 (EF1), and Arginine kinase (AK), were assessed in the CNS of B. mori. The postembryonic developmental (PED) stages used were the fifth late larval instar, early pupa, mid pupa, late pupa, and adult. The assessments were done at four different time points, Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0, 6, 12, and 18, to find stability towards 24-h rhythmic expression. RefFinder, geNorm, and Ct value analysis were performed. RefFinder and geNORM studies suggested stability order as TI3S4 &amp;gt; TI3S5 &amp;gt; RPs7, but Ct value evaluation showed stability order as TI3S5 &amp;gt; TI3S4 &amp;gt; RPs7. We therefore demonstrated that TI3S4, TI3S5, and RPs7 can be used as RG in various PED stages in CNS of B. mori (Strain: CB-hybrid, PM×CSR2) towards studies with effects of JH and 20 HE antagonists.",Frontiers in Insect Science,2024

10.4252/wjsc.v16.i6.656,RPLP0/TBP are the most stable reference genes for human dental pulp stem cells under osteogenic differentiation,"Daniel B Ferreira, Leticia M Gasparoni, Cristiane F Bronzeri, Katiucia B S Paiva","BACKGROUND
          Validation of the reference gene (RG) stability during experimental analyses is essential for correct quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) data normalisation. Commonly, in an unreliable way, several studies use genes involved in essential cellular functions [glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 18S rRNA, and β-actin] without paying attention to whether they are suitable for such experimental conditions or the reason for choosing such genes. Furthermore, such studies use only one gene when Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments guidelines recommend two or more genes. It impacts the credibility of these studies and causes distortions in the gene expression findings. For tissue engineering, the accuracy of gene expression drives the best experimental or therapeutical approaches.
          AIM
          To verify the most stable RG during osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) by RT-qPCR.
          METHODS
          We cultivated DPSCs under two conditions: Undifferentiated and osteogenic differentiation, both for 35 d. We evaluated the gene expression of 10 candidates for RGs [ribosomal protein, large, P0 (RPLP0 ), TATA-binding protein (TBP ), GAPDH , actin beta (ACTB ), tubulin (TUB ), aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1 ), tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta (YWHAZ ), eukaryotic translational elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1a ), succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A, flavoprotein (SDHA ), and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M )] every 7 d (1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d) by RT-qPCR. The data were analysed by the four main algorithms, ΔCt method, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper and ranked by the RefFinder method. We subdivided the samples into eight subgroups.
          RESULTS
          All of the data sets from clonogenic and osteogenic samples were analysed using the RefFinder algorithm. The final ranking showed RPLP0/TBP as the two most stable RGs and TUB/B2M as the two least stable RGs. Either the ΔCt method or NormFinder analysis showed TBP/RPLP0 as the two most stable genes. However, geNorm analysis showed RPLP0/EF1α in the first place. These algorithms’ two least stable RGs were B2M/GAPDH. For BestKeeper, ALAS1 was ranked as the most stable RG, and SDHA as the least stable RG. The pair RPLP0/TBP was detected in most subgroups as the most stable RGs, following the RefFinfer ranking.
          CONCLUSION
          For the first time, we show that RPLP0/TBP are the most stable RGs, whereas TUB/B2M are unstable RGs for long-term osteogenic differentiation of human DPSCs in traditional monolayers.",World Journal of Stem Cells,2024

However, consensus regarding ideal reference genes for relative long RNAs quantification in uEVs is not available as of date. Here we explored stable reference genes through profiling the long RNA expression by RNA‐seq following unsupervised analysis and validation studies. Candidate reference genes were identified using four algorithms: NormFinder, GeNorm, BestKeeper and the Delta Ct method, followed by validation. RNA profile showed uEVs contained abundant long RNAs information and the core transcriptome was related to cellular structures, especially ribosome which functions mainly as translation, protein and RNA binding molecules. Analysis of RNA‐seq data identified RPL18A, RPL11, RPL27, RACK1, RPSA, RPL41, H1‐2, RPL4, GAPDH, RPS27A as candidate reference genes. RT‐qPCR validation revealed that RPL41, RPSA and RPL18A were reliable reference genes for long RNA quantification in uEVs from patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetic nephropathy (DN), IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and prostate cancer (PCA). Interestingly, RPL41 also outperformed traditional reference genes in renal tissues of DN and IgAN, as well as in plasma EVs of several types of cancers. The stable reference genes identified in this study may facilitate development of uEVs as novel biomarkers and increase the accuracy and comparability of biomarker studies.",Journal of Extracellular Biology,2024

However, due to a shortage of effective and appropriate endogenous references, studies on molecular functional genes in Mylabris sibirica, have been tremendously limited. In this study, ten internal reference genes (ACT, ARF1, AK, EF1α, GAPDH, α-TUB, RPL6, RPL13, RPS3 and RPS18) were tested and assessed under four selected treatments including adult ages, adult tissues, temperatures, and sex by RT-qPCR based on five methods (Ct value, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder). Our findings showed that RPL6 and RPL13 were the most optimal internal reference gene combination for gene expression during various adult ages and under diverse temperatures; The combination of RPL6 and RPS18 was recommended to test gene transcription levels under different adult tissues. AK and RPL6 were the best reference genes in male and female adults. RPL6 and RPL13 were the most appropriate reference gene pair to estimate gene expression levels under four different tested backgrounds. The relative transcript levels of a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-N-acetylglucosamine-pyrophosphorylase (MsUAP), varied greatly according to normalization with the two most- and least-suited reference genes.

There have not yet been any articles on the methodical assessment and choice of the best reference genes for A. dahurica gene expression studies. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely employed as the predominant method for investigating gene expression. In order to ensure the precise determination of target gene expression outcomes in RT-qPCR analysis, it is imperative to employ stable reference genes. In this study, a total of 11 candidate reference genes including SAND family protein (SAND), polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), actin (ACT), TIP41-like protein (TIP41), cyclophilin 2 (CYP2), elongation factor 1 α (EF1α), ubiquitin-protein ligase 9 (UBC9), tubulin β-6 (TUB6), thioredoxin-like protein YLS8 (YLS8), and tubulin-α (TUBA) were selected from the transcriptome of A. dahurica. Subsequently, three statistical algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were employed to assess the stability of their expression patterns across seven distinct stimulus treatments. The outcomes obtained from these analyses were subsequently amalgamated into a comprehensive ranking using RefFinder. Additionally, one target gene, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), was used to confirm the effectiveness of the selected reference genes. According to the findings of this study, the two most stable reference genes for normalizing the expression of genes in A. dahurica are TIP41 and UBC9. Overall, our research has determined the appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR in A. dahurica and provides a crucial foundation for gene screening and identifying genes associated with the biosynthesis of active ingredients in A. dahurica.",Genes,2024

Palmyra palm is an important tropical dioecious tree crop with diverse uses. However, no reliable gene expression studies or housekeeping gene standardization have been documented, which limit crop improvement and utilization. In this work, four frequently used statistical tools such as RefFinder, NormFinder, Delta CT method and BestKeeper were applied to evaluate the constancy and fluctuation in expression of a chosen 10 internal control genes such as NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5-like (NAD5), β-actin, ACTIN CRD, alpha-tubulin, UBCE, EIF, EF2, AP1, GAPDH and UBQ2 in both vegetative and reproductive tissues of dioecious Palmyra palm. Six flower tissues and two leaf tissues from male and female palms were used in this study.  The findings indicated that NAD5-2 is the most reliable and constant housekeeping gene expressed during Palmyra palm flower development. The AGAMOUS and SEEDSTICK genes expression pattern in the flower development were used to validate the normalized expression of the four housekeeping genes that were chosen in order to further support the stability of those genes. Our results will be useful for further research on gene transcription level in Palmyra palms and also the above mentioned tool is very useful for the normalization of housekeeping genes of biological samples with different experimental conditions.",Research Journal of Biotechnology,2023

The parasitoid Exorista sorbillans (Diptera, Tachinidae) is the major pest of B. mori and also a promising candidate for biological control. However, the molecular interactions between hosts and dipteran parasitoids have only partially been studied. Gene expression analysis by reverse-transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is indispensable to characterise their interactions. Accurate normalisation of RT-qPCR-based gene expression requires the use of reference genes that are constantly expressed irrespective of experimental conditions. In this study, the expression stability of 13 traditionally used reference genes was estimated by five statistical algorithms (ΔCt, geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) to determine the best reference genes for gene expression studies in different tissues of B. mori under E. sorbillans parasitism. Specifically, TATA-box-binding protein was the best reference gene in epidermis and testis, while elongation factor 1α was the most stable gene in prothoracic gland and midgut. Elongation factor 1γ, ribosomal protein L3, actin A1, ribosomal protein L40, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A were the most suitable genes in head, silk gland, fat body, haemolymph, Malpighian tubule and ovary, respectively. Our study offers a set of suitable reference genes for gene expression normalisation in B. mori under the parasitic stress of E. sorbillans, which will benefit the in-depth exploration of host-dipteran parasitoid interactions, and also provide insights for further improvements of B. mori resistance against parasitoids and biocontrol efficacy of dipteran parasitoids.",Bulletin of Entomological Research,2023

Currently, there are no systematic studies on the banana endogenous reference gene. In this study, the MaSPS1 gene was identified as a candidate gene through bioinformatics analysis. The conservation of this gene in different genotypes of banana was tested using PCR, and its specificity in various crops and fruits was also examined. Southern blot analysis showed that there is only one copy of MaSPS1 in banana. The limit of detection (LOD) test showed that the LOD of the conventional PCR method is approximately 20 copies. The real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR) method also exhibited high specificity, with a LOD of approximately 10 copies. The standard curve of the qPCR method met the quantitative requirements, with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1.14 × 10−2 ng—about 20 copies. Also, the qPCR method demonstrated good repeatability and stability. Hence, the above results indicate that the detection method established in this study has strong specificity, a low detection limit, and good stability.

In this study, a total of 16 candidate reference genes (RPL32, RPS23, SDHA, UBQ, UCCR, GST, TATA−box, HSP70, GAPDH, RPL7A, SOD, RPS3, Actin, α−tubulin, AK, and EF1) were carefully chosen in R. pedestris, and their expression levels were assessed across various conditions, including different developmental stages, diverse tissues, temperature treatments, adult age, molting time, and mating status. Following this, the stability of these reference genes was evaluated using four algorithms (ΔCt, GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper). Ultimately, the comprehensive rankings were determined using the online tool RefFinder. Our results demonstrate that the reference gene for qRT-PCR analysis in R. pedestris is contingent upon the specific experimental conditions. RPL7A and EF1 are optimal reference genes for developmental stages. Furthermore, α−tubulin and EF1 exhibit the most stable expression across various adult tissues. RPL32 and RPL7A exhibit the most stable expression for adult age. For nymph age, RPL32 and SOD display the most stable expression. For temperature conditions, RPS23 and RPL7A were identified as the most suitable for monitoring gene expression.

In this study, we took the advantage of our RNA-seq datasets encompassing data from five rice varieties with diverse treatment conditions, identified 12 novel candidate reference genes, and conducted rigorous evaluations of their suitability across typical rice tissues. Comprehensive analysis of the leaves, shoots, and roots of two rice seedlings subjected to salt (30 mmol/L NaCl) and drought (air-dry) stresses have revealed that OsMED7, OsACT1, and OsOS-9 were the robust reference genes for leaf samples, while OsACT1, OsZOS3-23, and OsGDCP were recommended for shoots and OsMED7, OsOS-9, and OsGDCP were the most reliable reference genes for roots. Comparison results produced by different sets of reference genes revealed that all these newly recommended reference genes displayed less variation than previous commonly used references genes under the experiment conditions. Thus, selecting appropriate reference genes from RNA-seq datasets leads to identification of reference genes suitable for respective rice tissues under drought and salt stress. The findings offer valuable insights for refining the screening of candidate reference genes under diverse conditions through the RNA-seq database.

Doolan","AbstractThe efficacy of pre-erythrocytic stage malaria antigens or vaccine platforms is routinely assessed in murine models challenged with Plasmodium sporozoites. Relative liver-stage parasite burden is quantified using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RTqPCR), which relies on constitutively expressed endogenous control reference genes. However, the stability of host-reference gene expression for RTqPCR analysis following Plasmodium challenge and immunization has not been systematically evaluated. Herein, we evaluated the stability of expression of twelve common RTqPCR reference genes in a murine model of Plasmodium yoelii sporozoite challenge and DNA-adenovirus IV 'Prime-Target' immunization. Significant changes in expression for six of twelve reference genes were shown by one-way ANOVA, when comparing gene expression levels among challenge, immunized, and naïve mice groups. These changes were attributed to parasite challenge or immunization when comparing group means using post-hoc Bonferroni corrected multiple comparison testing. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA) and TATA-binding protein (TBP) were identified as stable host-reference genes suitable for relative RTqPCR data normalisation, using the RefFinder package. We defined a robust threshold of 'partial-protection’ with these genes and developed a strategy to simultaneously quantify matched host parasite burden and cytokine responses following immunisation or challenge. This is the first report systematically identifying reliable host reference genes for RTqPCR analysis following Plasmodium sporozoite challenge. A robust RTqPCR protocol incorporating reliable reference genes which enables simultaneous analysis of host whole-liver cytokine responses and parasite burden will significantly standardise and enhance results between international malaria vaccine efficacy studies.",Scientific Reports,2023

In the study, eight candidate reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, 18S, PPIA, B2M, SDHA, GUSB, and YWHAZ) were selected for RT-qPCR to detect their expression in NCM460, HT29, HCT116, SW480, SW620, DLD-1, LOVO and RKO cell lines. The stability of reference genes and the optimal panel were evaluated by geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software. As results, the expression levels of candidate reference genes differed in the colonic epithelial cell lines, and the number of optimal panel of reference genes is two. B2M and YWHAZ were the two most stable reference genes for NCM460, HCT116, SW620, LOVO, and RKO cell lines, while only one of B2M and YWHAZ was most stable in HT29 and SW480 cells.

                Trichoderma atroviride is a competitive soil-borne mycoparasitic fungus with extensive applications as a biocontrol agent in plant protection. Despite its importance and application potential, reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis in T. atroviride have not been evaluated. Light exerts profound effects on physiology, such as growth, conidiation, secondary metabolism, and stress response in T. atroviride, as well as in other fungi.

We measured and compared candidate reference genes using commonly applied statistical algorithms.
              
                Results
                Under cyclic light–dark cultivation conditions, tbp and rho were identified as the most stably expressed genes, while act1, fis1, btl, and sar1 were found to be the least stable. Similar stability rankings were obtained for cultures grown under complete darkness, with tef1 and vma1 emerging as the most stable genes and act1, rho, fis1, and btl as the least stable genes. Combining the data from both cultivation conditions, gapdh and vma1 were identified as the most stable reference genes, while sar1 and fis1 were the least stable. The selection of different reference genes had a significant impact on the calculation of relative gene expression, as demonstrated by the expression patterns of target genes pks4 and lox1.
              
                Conclusion
                The data emphasize the importance of validating reference genes for different cultivation conditions in fungi to ensure accurate interpretation of gene expression data.

10.1038/s41598-023-43892-3,Evaluation and validation of reference genes for RT-qPCR gene expression in Naegleria gruberi,"Tania Martín-Pérez, Martina Köhsler, Julia Walochnik","AbstractNaegleria gruberi is a free-living amoeboflagellate commonly found in freshwater and in soils around the world. It is a non-pathogenic relative of Naegleria fowleri, which is the etiologic agent of Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM). PAM occurs world-wide and it is considered a rare disease, but its fatality rate is high (96%) mainly because of delay in initiation of treatment due to misdiagnosis and lack of a specific treatment. The analysis of gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR in N. gruberi could be a highly efficient means to understand the pathogenicity of N. fowleri and also to find drug targets. Accurate RT-qPCR analysis requires correct normalization of gene expression data using reference genes (RG), whose expression should be constant under different experimental conditions. In this study, six genes, representing the most frequently used housekeeping genes, were selected for evaluation as reference genes in N. gruberi. The expression and stability of these genes was evaluated employing four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder). This work shows significant variations of the stability of RGs depending on the algorithms employed and on the experimental conditions (i.e. logarithmic, stationary, heat-shock and oxidative stress). The geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder analysis of all the experimental conditions in combination revealed that ACT and G6PD were the most stable RGs. While BestKeeper analysis showed that 18S and TBP were the most stable RGs. Moreover, normalization of HSP90 gene expression with the most stable RGs resulted in an upregulation whereas when the normalization was done with the unstable RGs, the gene expression was not reliable. Hence, the implications of this study are relevant to gene expression studies in N. gruberi.",Scientific Reports,2023

The biting midge Culicoides sonorensis is an important vector of livestock pathogens and is often used as a model species for biting midge research. Here, we examine the stable expression of six candidate reference genes in C. sonorensis: actin, β-tubulin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal protein subunit (RPS) 18, vacuolar ATPase subunit A (VhaA), and elongation factor 1-beta (EF1b). Gene expression was assessed under seven conditions, including cells treated with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), 3rd and 4th instar larvae treated with dsRNA, six developmental stages, four adult female body parts or tissue groups, and females injected with bluetongue virus or vesicular stomatitis virus. Stable gene expression was assessed using RefFinder, NormFinder, geNorm, and BestKeeper. The ranked results for each analysis tool under each condition and a comprehensive ranking for each condition are presented. The data show that optimal reference genes vary between conditions and that just two reference genes were necessary for each condition.

Barnyard millet (Echinochloa spp.) is an ancient crop in Asia and Africa that is widely cultivated for food and fodder. It thrives well under drought, salinity, cold, and heat environmental conditions, besides adapting to any soil type. To date, there are no gene expression studies performed to identify the potential candidate gene responsible for stress response in barnyard millet, due to lack of reference gene. Here, 10 candidate reference genes, Actin (ACT), α-tubulin (α-TUB), β-tubulin (β-TUB), RNA pol II (RP II), elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1α), adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), TATA-binding protein-like factor (TLF), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2 (UBC2), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2L5 (UBC5) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), were selected from mRNA sequences of E. crus-galli and E. colona var frumentacea. Five statistical algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCt, and RefFinder) were applied to determine the expression stabilities of these genes in barnyard millet grown under four different abiotic stress (drought, salinity, cold and heat) exposed at different time points. The UBC5 and ɑ-TUB in drought, GAPDH in salinity, GAPDH and APRT in cold, and EF-1α and RP II in heat were the most stable reference genes, whereas ß-TUB was the least stable irrespective of stress conditions applied. Further Vn/Vn + 1 analysis revealed two reference genes were sufficient to normalize gene expression across all sample sets. The suitability of identified reference genes was validated with Cu-ZnSOD (SOD1) in the plants exposed to different abiotic stress conditions. The results revealed that the relative quantification of the SOD1 gene varied according to reference genes and the number of reference genes used, thus highlighting the importance of the choice of a reference gene in such experiments. This study provides a foundational framework for standardizing RT-qPCR analyses, enabling accurate gene expression profiling in barnyard millet.",Scientific Reports,2023

In this sense, the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA) and Ribosomal Protein L-19 (RPL-19) reference genes (already described in other studies with sheep from different regions, breeds and infectious agents or in organisms evolutionarily close to sheep) were investigated in the abomasum, small and large intestines of resistant and susceptible crossbred sheep groups to gastrointestinal nematode infections in the Semi-arid region in Northeast of Brazil. The animals were naturally infected to determine the resistance or susceptibility status by counting eggs per gram (EPG) of feces from the gastrointestinal tract after 33 weeks of observations of infection evolution. Relative gene expression was performed by RT-qPCR methodology using Sybr green and relative gene expression stability was tested by different software programs such as REST, BestKeeper, geNorm and Normfinder. Our results showed the susceptible animals had increase in egg counts per gram of feces than resistant animals (p &lt; 0.001), and both groups showed a mixed infection by nematodes of the genus Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Oesophagostomum and Trichuris. Furthermore, we show the importance of analyzing different genes in different software programs and the importance to choose ideal reference genes. In this sense, GAPDH was the most stable gene in the abomasum, whereas SDHA was the most stable in the small and large intestines. In addition, we discuss about variables which can interfere in relative expression such as breed, species, climate and tissue. However, utilizing other reference genes already described in other studies with the same and different variables should be performed.",BMC Veterinary Research,2023

The expression stability of HKGs were also evaluated for paired fresh frozen tissues or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples obtained from CRC patients before and after chemoradiotherapy. The expression of YWHAZ and TBP encoding 14-3-3-zeta protein and TATA-binding protein were more stable than the other 12 HKGs in CRC cell lines, organoids, and patient-derived tissues after irradiation.

Pleurotus pulmonarius is a detoxifying agent for jatropha cake with additional potential as animal feed, edible mushroom and for enzyme production. For the characterization of fungal genes involved in phorbol ester degradation, together with other industrial applications, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a tool that enables accurate quantification of gene expression. For this, reliable analysis requires reference genes for normalization of mRNA levels validated under conditions employed for target genes.

                Background
                Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a crucial and widely used method for gene expression analysis. Selecting suitable reference genes is extremely important for the accuracy of RT-qPCR results. Commonly used reference genes are not always stable in various organisms or under different environmental conditions. With the increasing application of high-throughput sequencing, transcriptome analysis has become an effective method for identifying novel stable reference genes.
              
                Results
                In this study, we identified candidate reference genes based on transcriptome data covering embryos and larvae of early development, normal adult tissues, and the hindgut under sulfide stress using the coefficient of variation (CV) method in the echiuran Urechis unicinctus, resulting in 6834 (15.82%), 7110 (16.85%) and 13880 (35.87%) candidate reference genes, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed that the candidate reference genes were significantly enriched in cellular metabolic process, protein metabolic process and ribosome in early development and normal adult tissues as well as in cellular localization and endocytosis in the hindgut under sulfide stress. Subsequently, ten genes including five new candidate reference genes and five commonly used reference genes, were validated by RT-qPCR. The expression stability of the ten genes was analyzed using four methods (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and ∆Ct). The comprehensive results indicated that the new candidate reference genes were more stable than most commonly used reference genes. The commonly used ACTB was the most unstable gene. The candidate reference genes STX12, EHMT1, and LYAG were the most stable genes in early development, normal adult tissues, and hindgut under sulfide stress, respectively. The log2(TPM) of the transcriptome data was significantly negatively correlated with the Ct values of RT-qPCR (Ct =  − 0.5405 log2(TPM) + 34.51), which made it possible to estimate the Ct value before RT-qPCR using transcriptome data.

                Our study is the first to select reference genes for RT-qPCR from transcriptome data in Echiura and provides important information for future gene expression studies in U. unicinctus.

                Background
                The yeast Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) is routinely used for heterologous protein expression and is suggested as a model organism for yeast. Despite its importance and application potential, no reference gene for transcript analysis via RT-qPCR assays has been evaluated to date. In this study, we searched publicly available RNASeq data for stably expressed genes to find potential reference genes for relative transcript analysis by RT-qPCR in K. phaffii. To evaluate the applicability of these genes, we used a diverse set of samples from three different strains and a broad range of cultivation conditions. The transcript levels of 9 genes were measured and compared using commonly applied bioinformatic tools.
              
                Results
                We could demonstrate that the often-used reference gene ACT1 is not very stably expressed and could identify two genes with outstandingly low transcript level fluctuations. Consequently, we suggest the two genes, RSC1, and TAF10 to be simultaneously used as reference genes in transcript analyses by RT-qPCR in K. phaffii in future RT-qPCR assays.
              
                Conclusion
                The usage of ACT1 as a reference gene in RT-qPCR analysis might lead to distorted results due to the instability of its transcript levels. In this study, we evaluated the transcript levels of several genes and found RSC1 and TAF10 to be extremely stable. Using these genes holds the promise for reliable RT-qPCR results.

However, when using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to analyze the gene expression of this algae under abiotic stress, it is essential to find the suitable endogenous reference genes so to obtain reliable results. This study assessed the expression stability of 9 endogenous reference genes of Chlorella sp. TLD 6B under four abiotic stresses (drought, salt, cold and heat).

Moreover, the target gene KCS11 involved in very-long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis was employed to confirm the most and least stable reference genes in different organs, seeds at different development stages, and all the tested samples. The expression profiles of KCS11 were similar, with minor differences based on the analysis of different stable reference genes (either alone or in combination), while the expression profiles were diverse and the relative expression level was overestimated when using the least stable ones.

Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is currently the most common method for detecting gene expression levels due to its high sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and ease of use. However, this methodology is dependent on selecting an optimal reference gene to accurately normalize the RT-qPCR results. Ten candidate reference genes, which are homologues of genes used in other plant species and are common reference genes, were used to evaluate the expression stability under three stress-related experimental treatments (methyl jasmonate, ethylene, and low temperature) using multiple stability analysis methodologies. The results showed that, among the candidate reference genes, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAM) exhibited a higher expression stability under the experimental conditions tested. Using SAM as a reference gene, the expression profiles of 14 genes for key TIA enzymes and a WRKY1 transcription factor were examined under three experimental stress treatments that affect the accumulation of TIAs in U. rhynchophylla.

A total of 11 candidate reference genes (ACT, TUB, GAPDH, TIP41, CACS, HNR, EP, EF1α, EIF4α, PP2A and actin) were detected by qRT-PCR technology, and the stability of candidate genes was evaluated with the combination of four internal stability analysis software programs. The candidate reference genes exhibited differential stability of expression in roots, stems and leaves under phosphorus-deficiency and/or aluminum-toxicity stress. On the whole, the results showed that GAPDH, TIP41 and HNR were the most stable in the total of samples. In addition, for different tissues under various stresses, the selected reference genes were also different. CACS and PP2A were identified as two stable reference genes in roots through all three stress treatments (phosphate deficiency, aluminum toxicity, and the multiple stress treatment of aluminum toxicity and phosphate deficiency). Moreover, CACS was also stable as a reference gene in roots under each treatment (phosphate deficiency, aluminum toxicity, or multiple stresses of aluminum toxicity and phosphate deficiency). In stems under all three stress treatments, GAPDH and EIF4α were the most stable reference genes; for leaves, PP2A and TIP41 showed the two highest rankings in all three stress treatments. Finally, qRT-PCR analysis of the expression patterns of the target gene ALMT1 was performed to verify the selected reference genes. The application of the reference genes identified as internal controls for qRT-PCR analysis will enable accurate analysis of the target gene expression levels and expression patterns in centipedegrass under acid-soil-related stresses.",Plants,2023

(quinoa), a member of the Amaranthaceae family, is an allotetraploid annual plant, endemic to South America. The plant of C. quinoa presents significant ecological plasticity with exceptional adaptability to several environmental stresses, including salinity. The resilience of quinoa to several abiotic stresses, as well as its nutritional attributes, have led to significant shifts in quinoa cultivation worldwide over the past century. This work first defines germination sensu stricto in quinoa where the breakage of the pericarp and the testa is followed by endosperm rupture (ER). Transcriptomic changes in early seed germination stages lead to unstable expression levels in commonly used reference genes that are typically stable in vegetative tissues. Noteworthy, no suitable reference genes have been previously identified specifically for quinoa seed germination under salt stress conditions. This work aims to identify these genes as a prerequisite step for normalizing qPCR data. To this end, germinating seeds from UDEC2 and UDEC4 accessions, with different tolerance to salt, have been analyzed under conditions of absence (0 mM NaCl) and in the presence (250 mM NaCl) of sodium chloride. Based on the relevant literature, six candidate reference genes, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Monensin sensitivity1 (MON1), Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), Actin-7 (ACT7), Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC), and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S), were selected and assessed for stability using the RefFinder Tool encompassing the statistical algorithms geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and ΔCt in the evaluation. The data presented support the suitability of CqACT7 and CqUBC as reference genes for normalizing gene expression during seed germination under salinity stress. These recommended reference genes can be valuable tools for consistent qPCR studies on quinoa seeds.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2023

Choosing appropriate reference genes to normalize the data is essential for reducing errors. Gelsemium elegans is a highly poisonous but important medicinal plant used for analgesic and anti-swelling purposes. Gelsenicine is one of the vital active ingredients, and its biosynthesis pathway remains to be determined. In this study, G. elegans leaf tissue with and without the application of one of four hormones (SA, MeJA, ETH, and ABA) known to affect gelsenicine synthesis, was analyzed using ten candidate reference genes. The gene stability was evaluated using GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ∆CT, and RefFinder. The results showed that the optimal stable reference genes varied among the different treatments and that at least two reference genes were required for accurate quantification. The expression patterns of 15 genes related to the gelsenicine upstream biosynthesis pathway was determined by RT-qPCR using the relevant reference genes identified. Three genes 8-HGO, LAMT, and STR, were found to have a strong correlation with the amount of gelsenicine measured in the different samples. This research is the first study to examine the reference genes of G. elegans under different hormone treatments and will be useful for future molecular analyses of this medically important plant species.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2023

Selecting appropriate internal reference genes is the key to accurately analyzing the expression changes of target genes by RT-qPCR. To find out the most suitable internal reference genes for studying the gene expression in Broussonetia papyrifera under abiotic stresses (including drought, salt, and ZnSO4 treatments), seven different tissues of B. papyrifera, as well as the roots, stems, and leaves of B. papyrifera under the abiotic stresses were used as test materials, and 15 candidate internal reference genes were screened based on the transcriptome data via RT-qPCR. Then, the expression stability of the candidate genes was comprehensively evaluated through the software geNorm (v3.5), NormFinder (v0.953), BestKeeper (v1.0), and RefFinder. The best internal reference genes and their combinations were screened out according to the analysis results. rRNA and Actin were the best reference genes under drought stress.

OB is associated with multiple comorbidities, including some types of cancers. Specifically, prostate cancer (PCa) has been postulated as one of the tumors that could have a causal relationship with OB. Particularly, a specialized adipose tissue (AT) depot known as periprostatic adipose tissue (PPAT) has gained increasing attention over the last few years as it could be a key player in the pathophysiological interaction between PCa and OB. However, to date, no studies have defined the most appropriate internal reference genes (IRGs) to be used in gene expression studies in this AT depot. In this work, two independent cohorts of PPAT samples (n = 20/n = 48) were used to assess the validity of a battery of 15 literature-selected IRGs using two widely used techniques (reverse transcription quantitative PCR [RT-qPCR] and microfluidic-based qPCR array).

Ock, Gyu-Jin Rho, Sang-Il Lee, Won-Jae Lee, Sung-Lim Lee","Mesenchymal stem cells derived from rheumatoid arthritis patients (RA-MSCs) provide an understanding of a variety of cellular and immunological responses within the inflammatory milieu. Sustained exposure of MSCs to inflammatory cytokines is likely to exert an influence on genetic variations, including reference genes (RGs). The sensitive effect of cytokines on the reference genes of RA-SF-MSCs may be a variation factor affecting patient-derived MSCs as well as the accuracy and reliability of data. Here, we comparatively evaluated the stability levels of nine RG candidates, namely GAPDH, ACTB, B2M, EEF1A1, TBP, RPLP0, PPIA, YWHAZ, and HPRT1, to find the most stable ones. Alteration of the RG expression was evaluated in MSCs derived from the SF of healthy donors (H-SF-MSCs) and in RA-SF-MSCs using the geNorm and NormFinder software programs. The results showed that TBP, PPIA, and YWHAZ were the most stable RGs for the normalization of H-SF-MSCs and RA-SF-MSCs using RT-qPCR, whereas ACTB, the most commonly used RG, was less stable and performed poorly. Additionally, the sensitivity of RG expression upon exposure to proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) was evaluated. RG stability was sensitive in the H-SF-MSCs exposed to TNF-α and IL-1β but insensitive in the RA-SF-MSCs. Furthermore, the normalization of IDO expression using ACTB falsely diminished the magnitude of biological significance, which was further confirmed with a functional analysis and an IDO activity assay. In conclusion, the results suggest that TBP, PPIA, and YWHAZ can be used in SF-MSCs, regardless of their exposure to inflammatory cytokines.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2023

Borsos, Hajnalka Majoros, Zoltán G. Páhi, Zsuzsanna Ujfaludi, Tibor Pankotai","DNA repair pathways trigger robust downstream responses, making it challenging to select suitable reference genes for comparative studies. In this study, our goal was to identify the most suitable housekeeping genes to perform comparable molecular analyses for DNA damage-related studies. Choosing the most applicable reference genes is important in any kind of target gene expression-related quantitative study, since using the housekeeping genes improperly may result in false data interpretation and inaccurate conclusions. We evaluated the expressional changes of eight well-known housekeeping genes (i.e., 18S rRNA, B2M, eEF1α1, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT1, PPIA, and TBP) following treatment with the DNA-damaging agents that are most frequently used: ultraviolet B (UVB) non-ionizing irradiation, neocarzinostatin (NCS), and actinomycin D (ActD). To reveal the significant changes in the expression of each gene and to determine which appear to be the most acceptable ones for normalization of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) data, comparative and statistical algorithms (such as absolute quantification, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, and independent samples T-test) were conducted. Our findings clearly demonstrate that the genes commonly employed as reference candidates exhibit substantial expression variability, and therefore, careful consideration must be taken when designing the experimental setup for an accurate and reproducible normalization of RT-qPCR data. We used the U2OS cell line since it is generally accepted and used in the field of DNA repair to study DNA damage-induced cellular responses. Based on our current data in U2OS cells, we suggest using 18S rRNA, eEF1α1, GAPDH, GUSB, and HPRT1 genes for UVB-induced DNA damage-related studies. B2M, HPRT1, and TBP genes are recommended for NCS treatment, while 18S rRNA, B2M, and PPIA genes can be used as suitable internal controls in RT-qPCR experiments for ActD treatment. In summary, this is the first systematic study using a U2OS cell culture system that offers convincing evidence for housekeeping gene selection following treatment with various DNA-damaging agents. Here, we unravel an indispensable issue for performing and assessing trustworthy DNA damage-related differential gene expressional analyses, and we create a “zero set” of potential reference gene candidates.",Biomolecules,2023

Infection with these pathogens causes extensive changes in gene expression and the activation of hormone signal transduction. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is the most common technique used for gene expression validation. Screening proper reference genes for mung bean under pathogen infection and hormone treatment is a prerequisite for ensuring the accuracy of qRT-PCR data in mung bean disease-resistance research. In this study, six candidate reference genes (Cons4, ACT, TUA, TUB, GAPDH, and EF1α) were selected to evaluate the expression stability under four soil-borne disease pathogens (Pythium myriotylum, Pythium aphanidermatum, Fusarium oxysporum, and Rhizoctonia solani) and five hormone treatments (SA, MeJA, ETH, ABA, and GA3). In the samples from different treatments, the Ct value distribution of the six candidate reference genes was different. Under the condition of hormone treatment, the Ct value ranged from a minimum of 17.87 for EF1α to a maximum of 29.63 for GAPDH. Under the condition of pathogen infection, the Ct value ranged from a minimum of 19.43 for EF1α to a maximum of 31.82 for GAPDH. After primer specificity analysis, it was found that GAPDH was not specific, so the five reference genes Cons4, ACT, TUA, TUB, and EF1α were used in subsequent experiments. The software products GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder were used for qRT-PCR data analysis. In general, the best candidates reference genes were: TUA for SA, ABA, GA3, and Pythium myriotylum treatment; TUB for ETH treatment; ACT for MeJA and Fusarium oxysporum treatment; and EF1α for Pythium aphanidermatum and Rhizoctonia solani treatment. The most stably expressed genes in all samples were TUA, while Cons4 was the least stable reference gene. Finally, the reliability of the reference gene was further validated by analysis of the expression profiles of four mung bean genes (Vradi0146s00260, Vradi0158s00480, Vradi07g23860, and Vradi11g03350) selected from transcriptome data.

PACAP has been reported to influence energy homeostasis, including adaptive thermogenesis, an energy burning process in adipose tissue regulated by the SNS in response to cold stress and overfeeding. While research suggests PACAP acts centrally at the level of the hypothalamus, knowledge of PACAP's role within the sympathetic nerves innervating adipose tissues in response to metabolic stressors is limited. This work shows, for the first time, gene expression of PACAP receptors in stellate ganglia and highlights some differential expression with housing temperature.

We examined variations in the expression of eight candidate reference genes in the leaf and root tissues of sweet potatoes (eight nonvirus-infected or eight virus-infected samples). Parallel analyses with geNorm, NormFinder, and Best-Keeper show that different viral infections and origin tissues affect the expression levels of these genes. Based on the results of the evaluation of the three software, the adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation factor is suitable for nonvirus or virus-infected sweet potato leaves. Cyclophilin and ubiquitin extension proteins are suitable for nonvirus-infected sweet potato leaves. Phospholipase D1 alpha is suitable for virus-infected sweet potato leaves.

Successful qPCR requires the use of appropriate reference genes for the normalization of data. In the present study, we aimed to identify and assess the best-suited reference genes in near-isogenic resistant (R) and susceptible (S) tomato lines infected with begomovirus Tomato curly stunt virus (ToCSV). Ten candidate reference genes namely, Actin7 (ACT), β-6 Tubulin (TUB), Ubiquitin 3 (UBI), Clathrin adaptor complexes medium subunit (CAC), Phytoene desaturase (PDS), Expressed protein (EXP), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Adenine phosphoribosyl transferase-like protein (APT1), TAP42-interacting protein (TIP41) and Elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1α) were selected and evaluated for their expression stability in resistant and susceptible tomato leaves using the analytical tools geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. After ranking the reference genes from most to least stable, the results suggested that a combination ofACT,EXP, andEF1αin the S lines and a combination ofTIP41,APT1, andACTin the R line is appropriate for qPCR normalization. Furthermore, to validate the identified reference genes, iron superoxide dismutase (SOD), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were selected as targets for normalization. The relative expression of the target genes varied when normalized against the most stable reference genes in comparison to the least stable genes.

The normal growth and development of ruminant uterus caruncles are crucial to maintain gestation and fetal health in goats. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a reliable tool to study gene expression profiling for exploring the intrinsic mechanism underlying the conversion process of uterus caruncle tissue. However, the candidate housekeeping genes (HKGs) are required for normalizing the expression of function genes. In our study, 22 HKGs were selected from analyzing transcriptome data at non-pregnancy and pregnancy processes and previous reports about HKGs in goat tissues. We assessed them for expression suitability in 24 samples from uterus tissues at 15 non-pregnant days (Stage 1), early (Stage 2), and medium-later pregnant days (Stage 3). The expression stability of these genes was evaluated by using geNorm, Normfinder, Bestkeeper, and Delta Ct algorithms and, comprehensively, by ReFinder. In addition, the most and least stable HKGs were used to normalize the target genes expression of SPP1, VEGFA, and PAG8. It was found that traditional reference genes, such as ACTB and GAPDH, were not suitable for target gene normalization. In contrast, PPIB selected from RNA sequencing data and EIF3K selected from previous references showed the least variation and were recommended as the best HKGs during the nonpregnant stage and the whole stages of goat uterus caruncle tissue, respectively. It is the first time the HKGs genes in uterus during the non-pregnant day and throughout the total pregnancy have been explored. These findings found suitable HKGs in uterus caruncle tissues at various stages of non-pregnancy and pregnancy; these can be useful for gene expression studies to reveal the molecular mechanisms of uterus development in goats.",Animals,2023

Three studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of a porcine-specific ISC in a commercial porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) reverse transcription-qPCR. Study 1 evaluated the species specificity of the ISC by testing serum from seven non-porcine domestic species (n = 34). In Study 2, the constancy of ISC detection over time (≥42 days) was assessed in oral fluid (n = 130), serum (n = 215), and feces (n = 132) collected from individual pigs of known PRRSV status. In Study 3, serum (n = 150), oral fluid (n = 150), and fecal samples (n = 75 feces, 75 fecal swabs) from commercial herds were used to establish ISC reference limits. Study 1 showed that the ISC was porcine-specific, i.e., all samples from non-porcine species were ISC negative (n = 34). In Study 2, the ISC was detected in all oral fluid, serum, and fecal samples, but differed in concentration between specimens (p &lt; 0.05; mixed-effects regression model). The results of Study 3 were used to establish ISC reference limits for the 5th, 2.5th and 1.25th percentiles.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of its growth, development, and metabolism. The selection of suitable reference genes is critical for molecular biological analyses. To date, no research on reference genes as a foundation for gene expression analysis has been undertaken in L. megaphylla. In this study, 14 candidate genes were selected from the transcriptome database of L. megaphylla for RT-qPCR assay under different conditions. Results showed that helicase-15 and UBC28 were most stable in different tissues of seedlings and adult trees. For different leaf developmental stages, the best combination of reference genes was ACT7 and UBC36. UBC36 and TCTP were the best under cold treatment, while PAB2 and CYP20-2 were the best under heat treatment. Finally, a RT-qPCR assay of LmNAC83 and LmERF60 genes were used to further verify the reliability of selected reference genes above.

Briet. is a well-known traditional Chinese herbal medicine that has many beneficial effects such as anti-tumor, anti-fertility, blood fat-reducing, and liver-protective. The comprehensive utilization value of P. ternata is high and the development prospect is broad. However, low tuber production resulting from “sprout tumble” (ST) due to high temperature and light intensity has largely reduced its use. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the functional gene responses to high temperature and light. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is commonly used for accurately gene expression detection during gene function exploration. However, because the RT-qPCR results may vary depending on the conditions and environment, an internal reference gene (IRG) is needed to normalize the RT-qPCR data. Analyzing IRGs in P. ternata can help with subsequent functional characterization and verification of the genes regulating P. ternata growth. In this study, we screened 8 suitable IRGs, and determined the most suitable IRGs using the Ct value, GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper under shade and high-temperature conditions, and in different tissues. The results showed that 18S was a suitable IRG for P. ternata studies. This discovery has laid the foundation for further research on P. ternata, and is also beneficial for the exploration of more IRGs in medicinal plants.

However, in Dendrobium officinale, LCMs are yet to be fully studied and exploited due to the unavailability of reliable RGs (reference genes) for qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR) normalization. Hence, this study took advantage of previously released transcriptome data to select and evaluate the suitability of ten candidate RGs, including Actin (Actin), polyubiquitin (UBQ), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), elongation factor 1-α (EF1α), β-tubulin (β-TUB), α-tubulin (α-TUB), 60S ribosomal protein L13-1 (RPL13AD), aquaporin PIP1-2 (PIP1-2), Intima protein (ALB3) and Cyclin (CYCB1-2) for normalizing leaf color-related genes’ expression levels via qRT-PCR. Stability rankings analysis via common software Best-Keeper, GeNorm, and NormFinder disclosed that all ten genes met the requirements of RGs. Of them, EF1α exhibited the highest stability and was selected as the most reliable. The reliability and accuracy of EF1α were confirmed through qRT-PCR analysis of fifteen chlorophyll pathway-related genes. The expression patterns of these genes via EF1α normalization were consistent with the results by RNA-Seq.

In this study, eight housekeeping genes’ stability (RPS30, ACTR, 18S rRNA, ACT, RPL18, GAPDH, 28S rRNA, and TUB) was tested under five different experimental conditions, including male or female adults, somites (head, thorax, and abdomen), temperatures (0 °C, 25 °C, and 40 °C), diets (starvation, clear water, 10% honey water, Eucalyptus sap), and pesticides (acetone was used as a control, imidacloprid, monosultap). Gene stability was calculated using RefFinder, which integrates four algorithms (the ∆Ct method, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper). The findings implied that ACT and ACTR were the most accurate when comparing sexes. For analyzing different somites, 28S rRNA and RPL18 were ideal; the 28S rRNA and RRS30 were perfect for analyzing at different temperatures. The combination of ACT and GAPDH helped to analyze gene expression in different diets, and GAPDH and 28S rRNA were suitable for various pesticide conditions.

Background
Anemia and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) are common comorbidities experienced by preterm infants, yet the role of anemia on the pathogenesis of ROP remains unclear. Reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a sensitive technique for estimating the gene expression changes at the transcript level but requires identification of stably expressed reference genes for accurate data interpretation. This is particularly important for oxygen induced retinopathy studies given that some commonly used reference genes are sensitive to oxygen. This study aimed to identify stably expressed reference genes among eight commonly used reference genes in the neonatal rat pups’ retina upon exposure to cyclic hyperoxia-hypoxia, anemia, and erythropoietin administration at two age groups (P14.5 and P20) using Bestkeeper, geNorm, and Normfinder, three publicly available, free algorithms, and comparing their results to the in-silico prediction program, RefFinder.


Results
The most stable reference gene across both developmental stages was Rpp30, as predicted by Genorm, Bestkeeper, and Normfinder. RefFinder predicted Tbp to be the most stable across both developmental stages. At P14.5, stability varied by prediction program; at P20, RPP30 and MAPK1 were the most stable reference genes. Gapdh, 18S, Rplp0, and HPRT were predicted as the least stable reference genes by at least one of the prediction algorithms.


Conclusion
Expression of Rpp30 is the least affected by experimental conditions of oxygen induced retinopathy, phlebotomy induced anemia and erythropoietin administration at both timepoints of P14.5 and P20.

The measurement of transcriptional levels through RT-qPCR critically depends on reference genes used for normalization. Here, we devised a strategy to select appropriate reference genes for a specific clinical/experimental setting based on publicly available transcriptomic datasets and a pipeline for RT-qPCR assay design and validation. As a proof-of-principle, we applied this strategy to identify and validate reference genes for transcriptional studies of bone-marrow plasma cells from patients with AL amyloidosis. We performed a systematic review of published literature to compile a list of 163 candidate reference genes for RT-qPCR experiments employing human samples. Next, we interrogated the Gene Expression Omnibus to assess expression levels of these genes in published transcriptomic studies on bone-marrow plasma cells from patients with different plasma cell dyscrasias and identified the most stably expressed genes as candidate normalizing genes. Experimental validation on bone-marrow plasma cells showed the superiority of candidate reference genes identified through this strategy over commonly employed “housekeeping” genes.

Computational algorithms (geNorm, Normfinder, ΔCt, BestKeeper, RefFinder) were applied to estimate the expression stability of each HKG or combinations of them, within and between tissues, under both steady-state and systemic inflammatory conditions. Rplp2 was ranked as the most suitable in the healthy and injured lung, kidney, and skeletal muscle, whereas Rplp2 and either Hprt1 or Pgk1 were the most suitable in the healthy and injured liver, respectively. However, the geometric mean of the three most stable genes was deemed the most stable internal reference control. Actb and Tbp were the least stable in normal tissues, whereas Gapdh and Tbp were the least stable across all tissues post-trauma.

UB2L3 was chosen as a reference gene because it exhibited lower intra- and inter-sample variation. vasa transcripts were expressed in all the developmental stages, while dnd1 was expressed only up to 40 d°C. Nanos3a was expressed in later stages and remained at its peak for a shorter period, while sdf1 showed an irregular pattern of mRNA expression. The mRNA expression levels of SD genes were observed to be upregulated during the later stages of development, prior to hatching.

The stability analysis was performed using the RefFinder tool, which combines four statistical algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and the comparative ΔCt method). Our results showed that RCE1, SAC52 and TUA2 had the most stable expression in different flower developmental stages while YLS8, HIS3.3 and ACT7 were the top-ranking reference genes for normalisation in mutant studies. Furthermore, we validated our results by analysing the expression pattern of genes involved in reproduction and examining the expression of these genes in published mutant backgrounds. Overall, we provided a pool of appropriate reference genes for expression studies in reproductive tissues of A. thaliana, which will facilitate further gene expression studies in this context. More importantly, we presented a framework that will promote a consistent and accurate analysis of gene expression in any scientific field. Simultaneously, we highlighted the relevance of clearly defining and describing the experimental conditions associated with qPCR to improve scientific reproducibility.",Biomolecules,2023

Kudo is a perennial and unique medicinal plant of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. It has the effects of diminishing inflammation, activating blood circulation, removing blood stasis, reducing swelling, and relieving pain. However, thus far, reliable reference gene identifications have not been reported in wild L. rotata. In this study, we identified suitable reference genes for the analysis of gene expression related to the medicinal compound synthesis in wild L. rotata subjected to five different-altitude habitats. Based on the RNA-Seq data of wild L. rotata from five different regions, the stability of 15 candidate internal reference genes was analyzed using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. TFIIS, EF-1α, and CYP22 were the most suitable internal reference genes in the leaves of L. rotata from different regions, while OBP, TFIIS, and CYP22 were the optimal reference genes in the roots of L. rotata. The reference genes identified here would be very useful for gene expression studies with different tissues in L. rotata from different habitats.",Genes,2023

Accurate gene expression profile analysis will help further reveal the molecular mechanism of nutrient and energy metabolism in the yak stomach. RT-qPCR is regarded as an accurate and dependable method for analyzing gene expression. The selection of reference genes is essential to obtain meaningful RT-qPCR results, especially in longitudinal gene expression studies of tissues and organs. Our objective was to select and validate optimal reference genes from across the transcriptome as internal controls for longitudinal gene expression studies in the yak stomach. In this study, 15 candidate reference genes (CRGs) were determined according to transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) results and the previous literature. The expression levels of these 15 CRGs were quantified using RT-qPCR in the yak stomach, including the rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum at five stages: 0 days, 20 days, 60 days, 15 months and three years old (adult). Subsequently, the expression stabilities of these 15 CRGs were evaluated via four algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and the comparative CT method. Furthermore, RefFinder was employed to obtain a comprehensive ranking of the stability of CRGs. The analysis results indicate that RPS15, MRPL39 and RPS23 are the most stable genes in the yak stomach throughout the growth cycle. In addition, to verify the reliability of the selected CRGs, the relative expression levels of HMGCS2 were quantified via RT-qPCR using the three most stable or the three least stable CRGs. Overall, we recommend combining RPS15, MRPL39 and RPS23 as reference genes for the normalization of RT-qPCR data in the yak stomach throughout the growth cycle.",Animals,2023

Positive-sense single-stranded (ss(+)) RNA viruses form a major part of all known plant viruses, and some of them are damaging pathogens of agriculturally important crops. Analysis of gene expression following infection by ss(+) RNA viruses is crucial for the identification of potential anti-viral factors. However, viral infections are known to globally affect gene expression and therefore selection and validation of reference genes for RT-qPCR is particularly important. In this study, the expression of commonly used reference genes for RT-qPCR was studied in Nicotiana benthamiana following single infection by 11 ss(+) RNA viruses, including five tobamoviruses, four potyviruses, one potexvirus and one polerovirus. Stability of gene expression was analyzed in parallel by four commonly used algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and Delta CT, and RefFinder was finally used to summarize all the data. The most stably expressed reference genes differed significantly among the viruses, even when those viruses were from the same genus.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay is one of the most common methods used for quantification of miRNA expression, and levels of expression are normalized by comparing with reference genes. The present study was intended to identify the appropriate reference genes for normalizing the level of miRNA expression in various developmental stages and tissues such as the bud development process, flower development stages, and different tissues of tree peony of different flowering times. Five algorithms (Delta Ct, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) were used for stability analysis. The results showed that mtr-MIR160b-p3 and gma-miR394a-5p were the most stable miRNAs expressed during the bud development process of early-flowering tree peony ‘Feng dan’; PC-5p-19095 was the most stable during the bud development process of late-flowering tree peony ‘Lian he’, followed by gma-miR394a-5p and mtr-MIR160b-p3; the mtr-miR159a was the most stable miRNA expressed in the flower development stages of different tree peony varieties. The PC-3p-871 was the most stable miRNA expressed in different tissues of early-flowering tree peony ‘Feng dan’, followed by PC-5p-4, and PC-5p-4 was the most stable in late-flowering tree peony ‘Lian he’, followed by the mtr-miR168b.

The method requires using some stably expressed genes as a reference to accurately normalize the RT-qPCR data. However, under various stresses and hormone treatments, the levels of most reference genes vary. Environmental variations also influence their expression levels. The lack of validated, stably expressed reference genes can mislead the study of gene function in pears. “Huangguan” pears have recently become the focus of research on stress resistance mechanisms, such as high resistance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to select the optimal reference genes in Huangguan pears, and we analyzed the expression of the genes EF1α, ACT, SKD1, YLS8, UBQ, GAPDH, TUB, and WDP in a series of pear leaf sets under various stresses and hormone treatments. Using different statistical algorithms, we found that under various treatments, the WDP gene had more stable expression, ACT was the most stable under MeJA treatment, YLS8 was the most valuable reference gene under ABA hormone and heat stress conditions, and GAPDH showed worst results compared to other housekeeping genes, except under heat stress. These results will supply valuable and updated information for the selection of housekeeping genes in pears under biotic and abiotic stresses in the future.",Horticulturae,2023

Eisen","Reference genes are frequently used for the normalization of quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRTPCR) data in gene expression studies. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common causes of biofilm-related infections. Savirin and ticagrelor show in vitro as well as in vivo antibiofilm activity against S. aureus. The main aim of this study was to identify the most stably expressed reference genes to study the effect of these molecules on genes in a strong biofilm producing S. aureus isolate isolated from biofilm-related infection. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed by using relative quantification method. Four different algorithms, delta Ct, normfinder, bestkeeper, and genorm, followed by a comprehensive analysis was used to identify the most stable reference genes from a list of sixteen different candidate reference genes. All four algorithms reported different results, with some comparable findings among some methods. In the comprehensive analysis of the results of all the algorithms used, the most stable reference genes found were spa, rpoD, and pyk for savirin treatment experiment and gapdH, gyrA, and gmk for ticagrelor treatment experiment. The optimal number of reference genes required was two for both the experimental conditions. Despite having some drawbacks, each algorithm can reliably determine an appropriate reference gene independently. However, based on consensus ranking and the required optimal number of reference genes reported, spa and rpoD were the most appropriate reference genes for savirin treatment experiment, and gapdH and gyrA were most appropriate for ticagrelor treatment experiment. This study provides baseline data on reference genes to study the effect of savirin or ticagrelor treatment on the expression of potential reference genes in S. aureus. We recommend prior re-validation of reference genes on a case-by-case basis before they can be used.",Microorganisms,2023

Nine candidate reference genes were screened based on garlic transcriptome sequence data. RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression levels of the aforementioned reference genes in specific tissues under drought and cold stress. Then, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and ReFinder were used to consider the consistency of the expression levels of candidate reference genes. Finally, the stress-responsive gene expression of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) was quantitatively evaluated to confirm the chosen reference genes. Our results indicated that there were variations in the abundance and stability of nine reference gene transcripts underneath cold and drought stress, among which ACT and UBC-E2 had the highest transcript abundance, and 18S rRNA and HIS3 had the lowest transcript abundance. UBC and UBC-E2 were the most stably expressed genes throughout all samples; UBC and UBC-E2 were the most stably expressed genes during cold stress, and ACT and UBC were the most stably expressed genes under drought stress. The most stably expressed genes in roots, pseudostems, leaves, and cloves were EF1, ACT, HIS3, UBC, and UBC-E2, respectively, while GAPDH was the most unstable gene during drought and cold stress conditions and in exclusive tissues. Taking the steady reference genes UBC-E2, UBC, and ACT as references during drought and cold stress, the reliability of the expression levels was further demonstrated by detecting the expression of AsAPX. Our work thereby offers a theoretical reference for the evaluation of gene expression in garlic in various tissues and under stress conditions.",Plants,2023

However, the majority of animal studies use a single reference gene without any prior evaluation. Therefore, many qPCR results from rodent studies can be misleading, affecting not only reproducibility but also translatability. In this study, the expression stability of reference genes for mRNA and miRNA in archived FFPE samples of 117 C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice (males and females) from 9 colitis experiments (dextran sulfate sodium; DSS) were evaluated and their expression analysis was performed. In addition, we investigated whether normalization reduced/neutralized the influence of inter/intra-experimental factors which we systematically included in the study. Two statistical algorithms (NormFinder and Bestkeeper) were used to determine the stability of reference genes. Multivariate analysis was made to evaluate the influence of normalization with different reference genes on target gene expression in regard to inter/intra-experimental factors. Results show that archived FFPE samples are a reliable source of RNA and imply that the FFPE procedure does not change the ranking of stability of reference genes obtained in fresh tissues. Multivariate analysis showed that the histological picture is an important factor affecting the expression levels of target genes.",Biology,2023

However, up to date, there are no studies reported on the selection of suitable reference genes in this fish, which is crucial for guaranteeing accurate and reliable results in RT-qPCR analyses. This study aimed at screening the most stable reference genes in the ovary and pituitary at different ovarian stages, which is of great significance for further research on the reproductive regulation mechanism of female S. argus. In this study, we selected twenty-one genes as the candidate reference genes, including four genes in the ovary (EEF1A, ACTB, B2M, and HPRT1), and seventeen genes in the pituitary (B2M, APOA1, CGBA, RPLP0, GNRHR, GUSB, TBP, SLC25A5, RPL4, PLA1A, GAPDH, GNB2L1, CTFS, HPRT1, RPS2, TFRC, and TUBB4B). To analyze the stability of the potential reference genes, we first used four commonly used software, BestKeeper, GeNorm, NormFinder, and ΔCt, and then we established comprehensive rankings with ReFinder. The results indicate that RPL4 and GNB2L1, and EEF1A and HPRT1 were the most appropriate reference genes for the pituitary and ovary of S. argus, respectively, in the three developmental stages of the ovary. Additionally, GeNorm analysis suggested that for the accurate normalization of gene expression, two reference genes were reliable in the ovary and pituitary of S. argus. To the best of our knowledge and understanding, this is the first study to identify appropriate reference genes for analyzing gene expression in S. argus. Consequently, this study can be used as a foundation for future research on the reproduction of S. argus.",Fishes,2023

Selection of reliable reference genes (RGs) for the normalization of real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) data is crucial to obtain accurate gene expression results. Among the genes with totally unrelated biological functions, six candidate RGs (ADF2, CYB5, iPGAM, SCL13, TRXL3-3, and VHA-H) with low variation in expression according to RNA-seq analyses, were selected for future expression studies of anthocyanin-related genes in three different experiments: leaf colour comparison (green vs. red) in commercial varieties; tissue comparison (leaf vs. stem) in a wild relative; and drought stress experiment in commercial and traditional varieties, and a wild relative. Expression profiles of the candidate RGs were obtained by qPCR and their stability was assessed by four different analytical tools, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and Delta Ct method, all integrated in RefFinder. All results considered, we recommend CYB5 to be used as RG for the leaf colour experiment and TRXL3-3 for the tissue and drought stress ones, as they were the most stable genes in each case. RNA-seq is useful to preselect novel RGs although validation by qPCR is still advisable.

Despite these valuable properties, the genes involved in the biosynthetic pathways in M. officinalis are not yet well-explored when compared to other members of the mint family. For that, gene expression studies using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) are an excellent tool. Although qRT-PCR can provide accurate results, its accuracy is highly reliant on the expression and stability of the reference gene used for normalization. Hence, selecting a suitable experiment-specific reference gene is very crucial to obtain accurate results. However, to date, there are no reports for experiment-specific reference genes in M. officinalis. Therefore, in the current study, ten commonly used reference genes were assessed for their suitability as optimal reference genes in M. officinalis under various abiotic stress conditions and different plant organs. The candidate genes were ranked based on BestKeeper, comparative ΔCt, geNorm, NormFinder, and RefFinder. Based on the results, we recommend the combination of EF-1α and GAPDH as the best reference genes to normalize gene expression studies in M. officinalis. On the contrary, HLH71 was identified as the least-performing gene. Thereafter, the reliability of the optimal gene combination was assessed by evaluating the relative gene expression of the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) gene under two elicitor treatments (gibberellic acid and jasmonic acid). PAL is a crucial gene involved directly or indirectly in the production of various economically important secondary metabolites in plants. Suitable reference genes for each experimental condition are also discussed.

Schwarz, Veronika A. Nikitina, Darya U. Krytskaya, Ksenia P. Shcherbakova, Alexander N. Trofimov","Reverse transcription followed by quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has become the gold standard in mRNA expression analysis. However, it requires an accurate choice of reference genes for adequate normalization. The aim of this study was to validate the reference genes for qPCR experiments in the brain of rats in the model of mild ketosis established through supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and intermittent fasting. This approach allows to reproduce certain neuroprotective effects of the classical ketogenic diet while avoiding its adverse effects. Ketogenic treatment targets multiple metabolic pathways, which may affect the reference gene expression. The standard chow of adult Wistar rats was supplemented with MCT (2 ml/kg orogastrically, during 6 h of fasting) or water (equivolume) for 1 month. The mRNA expression of 9 housekeeping genes (Actb, B2m, Gapdh, Hprt1, Pgk1, Ppia, Rpl13a, Sdha, Ywhaz) in the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal and ventral hippocampus was measured by RT-qPCR. Using the RefFinder® online tool, we have found that the reference gene stability ranking strongly depended on the analyzed brain region. The most stably expressed reference genes were found to be Ppia, Actb, and Rpl13a in the medial prefrontal cortex; Rpl13a, Ywhaz, and Pgk1 in the dorsal hippocampus; Ywhaz, Sdha, and Ppia in the ventral hippocampus. The B2m was identified as an invalid reference gene in the ventral hippocampus, while Sdha, Actb, and Gapdh were unstable in the dorsal hippocampus. The stabilities of the examined reference genes were lower in the dorsal hippocampus compared to the ventral hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. When normalized to the three most stably expressed reference genes, the Gapdh mRNA was upregulated, while the Sdha mRNA was downregulated in the medial prefrontal cortex of MCT-fed animals. Thus, the expression stability of reference genes strongly depends on the examined brain regions. The dorsal and ventral hippocampal areas differ in reference genes stability rankings, which should be taken into account in the RT-qPCR experimental design.",PLOS ONE,2023

DC, widely known as folk medicinal herb and ornamental plant, has been extensively investigated due to its unique leaf color, anti-cancer and other pharmacological activities. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was an excellent tool for the analysis of gene expression with its high sensitivity and quantitative properties. Normalizing gene expression with stable reference genes was essential for qRT-PCR accuracy. In addition, no studies have yet been performed on the selection, verification and stability of internal reference genes suitable for A. kteniophylla, which has greatly hindered the biomolecular researches of this species. In this study, 29 candidate genes were successfully screened according to stable expression patterns of large-scale RNA seq data that from a variety of tissues and the roots of different growth stages in A. kteniophylla. The candidates were then further determined via qRT-PCR in various experimental samples, including MeJA, ABA, SA, NaCl, CuSO4, AgNO3, MnSO4, CoCl2, drought, low temperature, heat, waterlogging, wounding and oxidative stress. To assess the stability of the candidates, five commonly used strategies were employed: delta-CT, geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and the comprehensive tool RefFinder. In summary, UBC2 and UBA1 were found to be effective in accurately normalizing target gene expression in A. kteniophella regardless of experimental conditions, while PP2A-2 had the lowest stability. Additionally, to verify the reliability of the recommended reference genes under different colored leaf samples, we examined the expression patterns of six genes associated with anthocyanin synthesis and regulation. Our findings suggested that PAP1 and ANS3 may be involved in leaf color change in A. kteniphella.

While quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has been extensively employed for gene expression level detection, the selection of suitable reference genes is imperative to ensure precise gene expression quantification across diverse conditions. This study aims to identify stable reference genes in quinoa seeds under ABA and GA, in order to provide a basis for subsequent research on PHS. Seeds were subjected to different concentrations of ABA and GA (10 μM, 50 μM, 100 μM, and 200 μM). The most suitable treatment concentration was determined based on seed viability. Here, MON1, GAPDH, EIF3, EF1α, ACT, TUB1, and TUB6 were selected as candidate genes. The suitability of these reference genes under different conditions was assessed using various methods including Ct values, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, Delta Ct, and RefFinder. Based on the results obtained from the hormone experiments, it was observed that the application of 100 μM ABA and 200 μM GA yielded the most advantageous outcomes. Additionally, the most appropriate reference genes for different treatments are ACT and TUB1 (H2O treatment), EIF3 and MON1 (ABA, GA treatment and also for the combined data set of the three groups). However, GAPDH exhibited the least stability across all treatments. In summary, ACT is recommended as the reference gene for natural quinoa germination, while EIF3 and MON1 should be used for ABA and GA treatments.",Journal of Seed Science,2023

The current study was performed to identify suitable reference genes to facilitate future gene expression and function analyses via quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Eight reference genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), RPS13, RPL8, RPS3, α-Tub, β-actin, RPL32, and elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1-α) were selected. Their expression levels were determined under four different experimental conditions (developmental stages, adult tissues, sugar treatment, and starvation treatment) using qRT-PCR technology. The stability was evaluated with five methods (Ct value, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder). The results showed that GAPDH, RPL32, and EF1-α were ranked as the best reference gene combinations for measuring gene expression levels among different developing stages and in various starvation treatments. RPL8 and RPS3 were recommended to normalize the gene expression levels among different adult tissues. RPL32, β-actin, and EF1-α were recommended sugar-feeding conditions. To validate the utility of the selected reference pair, RPL8, and RPS3, we estimated the tissue-biased expression level of a chemosensory protein gene (AaphCSP1).

Widely used reference genes are mostly chosen by intuition or from pan-cancer transcriptome data and lack experimental validation by qRT-PCR in the context of lung cancer. This study evaluated the stability of candidate reference genes in lung cancer cell lines under normal homeostasis, hypoxia, and serum deprivation to screen for robust reference genes for qRT-PCR in lung cancer studies. The stability of reference gene combinations was also assessed. We found that most of the stably expressed genes from pan-cancer transcriptome analyses were not sufficiently stable under some of the tested conditions. CIAO1, CNOT4, and SNW1 were found to be the most stable reference genes under various conditions. Greater stability was achieved by combining more reference genes. We further used the hypoxia biomarker hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α to demonstrate that choosing inappropriate reference genes can lead to incorrect qRT-PCR results. We also found that the stable reference genes were irrelevant to malignancy, which may explain their stability under various conditions that cancer cells often encounter.

Here, we took advantage of a massive transcriptomic high-throughput analysis of various developmental stages of the gut and associated-bacteriomes of the cereal weevil Sitophilus oryzae and identified a subset of stably expressed genes with the potential to be used as housekeeping genes from the larva to the adult stage. We employed several normalization techniques to select the most suitable genes among our subset. Our final selection includes two genes–TAO, and YTH3–which can also be used to compare transcript abundance at various developmental stages in symbiotic insects, and in insects devoid of endosymbionts (aposymbiotic). Since they are well conserved, these genes have the potential to be useful for many other insect species. This work confirms the interest in using large-scale, unbiased methods for reference gene selection.",Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,2023

The selection of appropriate housekeeping genes is the key to accurately calculating the expression level of target genes and conducting gene function studies. In this study, the expression of eight candidate reference genes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta-actin (β-actin), 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1), TATA box binding protein (TBP), ribosomal protein L13 (RPL13), and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein (YWHAZ), in the duodenal epithelial tissue of 42-day-old meat-type ducks were detected using qPCR. Furthermore, their expression stability was analyzed using the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper programs. The results indicated that HMBS and YWHAZ were the most stably expressed genes. All three programs indicated that the expression of 18S rRNA was the least stable, making it unsuitable for the study of gene expression in meat-type duck tissues.

Gene expression normalization by Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) requires the selection and validation of appropriate reference genes (RGs). Hence, 15 candidate RGs were selected from transcriptome data of N. asiatica. Their expression stability was evaluated with five algorithms (∆Ct, Normfinder, GeNorm, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) for sample types differing in the developmental stage, sex, tissue type, and in response to five different abiotic stresses.

In this study, five housekeeping genes [RPL7 (ribosomal protein L7), 18 S (18 S ribosomal RNA), EF1A (elongation factor 1α), ACTB (β‐actin) and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase)] were chosen to evaluate their reliability as reference genes for quantitative real‐time PCR (qPCR) for the study of Anguilla anguilla. The expression of the selected genes in different eel tissues was determined using qPCR at different growth stages or upon challenge by Anguillid herpesvirus (AngHV), and the expression levels of these genes were then compared and evaluated using the geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. Then, RefFinder was used to comprehensively rank the examined housekeeping genes. Interestingly, the expression of the evaluated housekeeping genes exhibited tissue‐dependent and treatment‐dependent variations. In different growth periods A. anguilla tissues, the most stable genes were the following: ACTB in mucus; 18 S in skin and kidney; RPL7 in muscle, gill, intestine and brain; EF1A in heart and liver; and GAPDH in spleen. In contrast, in AngHV‐challenged A. anguilla tissues, the most stable genes were the following: 18 S in mucus; RPL7 in skin, gill, heart, spleen, kidney and intestine; EF1A in muscle and liver; and ACTB in brain. Further comparison analysis indicated that the expression of RPL7 and EF1A was stable in multiple A. anguilla tissues in different growth periods and in eels challenged by AngHV. Nonetheless, the expression level of GAPDH in eel tissues was lower, and it was unstable in several tissues. These results indicated that the selection of reference genes for qPCR analysis in A. anguilla should be made in accordance with experimental parameters, and both RPL7 and EF1A could be used as reference genes for qPCR study of A. anguilla at different growth stages or upon challenge by AngHV.

The present study proposes reinforcement of the normalization of gene expression data by integrating analytical revision at critical steps of those accepted procedures. In vitro olive adventitious rooting was used as an experimental system. Candidate RGs were ranked according to transcriptional stability according to several methods. An algorithm of one of these programs (GeNorm) was adapted to allow for partial automatization of RG selection for any strategy of transcriptional-gene stability ordering. In order to choose the more appropriate set of RGs, the achieved results were analytically revised, with special emphasis on biasing effects such as co-regulation. The obtained putative RG sets were also tested for cases restricted to fewer variables. The set formed by the genes H2B, OUB and ACT is valid for normalization in transcriptional studies on olive microshoot rooting when comparing treatments, time points and assays.

                Nitraria sibirica Pall. is a halophytic shrub with strong environmental adaptability that can survive in extremely saline-alkali and drought-impacted environments. Gene expression analysis aids in the exploration of the molecular mechanisms of plant responses to abiotic stresses. RT–qPCR is the most common technique for studying gene expression. Stable reference genes are a prerequisite for obtaining accurate target gene expression results in RT–qPCR analysis.
              
                Results
                In this study, a total of 10 candidate reference genes were selected from the transcriptome of N. sibirica, and their expression stability in leaves and roots under different treatment conditions (salt, alkali, drought, cold, heat and ABA) was evaluated with the geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, comparative ΔCt and RefFinder programs. The results showed that the expression stability of the candidate reference genes was dependent on the tissue and experimental conditions tested. ACT7 combined with R3H, GAPDH, TUB or His were the most stable reference genes in the salt- or alkali-treated leaves, salt-treated roots and drought-treated roots, respectively; R3H and GAPDH were the most suitable combination for drought-treated leaves, heat-treated root samples and ABA-treated leaves; DIM1 and His maintained stable expression in roots under alkali stress; and TUB combined with R3H was stable in ABA-treated roots. TBCB and GAPDH exhibited stable expression in heat-treated leaves; TBCB, R3H, and ERF3A were stable in cold-treated leaves; and the three most stable reference genes for cold-treated roots were TBCB, ACT11 and DIM1. The reliability of the selected reference genes was further confirmed by evaluating the expression patterns of the NsP5CS gene under the six treatment conditions.

                Background
                In molecular biology studies, the selection of optimal reference genes is of vital importance for accurately quantifying gene expression. The purpose of the present study was to screen the most stable reference genes in different muscle tissues of New Zealand white rabbits and Yufeng yellow rabbits.
              
                Methods and results
                Results indicated that the most stable reference genes in the muscle tissues of New Zealand white rabbits were HPRT1, ACTB and PPIC, while HPRT1, PPIC, and RPL13A were the most stable reference genes in muscle tissues of Yufeng yellow rabbits. However, in the longissimus dorsi muscle and the abdominal wall muscle of both varieties, the most stable reference genes were HPRT1, RPL13A, and SDHA. In the quadriceps femoris muscle, the most stable reference genes were ACTB, HPRT1, and SDHA. Furthermore, the relative abundance of MYOG, MYH3 and MSTN was used to confirm the suitability and reliability of the selected most stable reference genes and the most unstable reference gene. Results revealed the same expression patterns of these myogenic genes when normalized according to the most stable genes, while normalization against the unstable reference gene altered the observed expression patterns.
              
                Conclusions
                Taken together, our results demonstrated that the most stable reference genes varied among different muscle tissues and different breeds of rabbits. However, HPRT1, PPIC and SDHA presented high stability among all examined reference genes; thus, the combined analysis of HPRT1/ PPIC/ SDHA gene provides the best reference for RT-qPCR in muscle tissues of New Zealand white rabbits and Yufeng yellow rabbits, while HPRT1 is a better choice than other reference genes when using a single reference gene to assess target gene expression. Our results provide basic data for better measuring target gene expression profiles in muscle tissues of rabbits.

In particular, in the normalization of &lt;i&gt;GnRH&lt;/i&gt; expression in the hypothalamus against several stable RGs, &lt;i&gt;PPIA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HPRT1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;YWHAZ&lt;/i&gt;, could generate significant (p&lt;0.05) elevation of &lt;i&gt;GnRH&lt;/i&gt; in the preovulatory phase compared to the luteal phase, but the traditional RGs with the least stability (&lt;i&gt;18S&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ACTB&lt;/i&gt;) did not show a significant difference between groups.Conclusion: These results indicate the importance of verifying RG stability prior to commencing research and may contribute to experimental design in the field of animal reproductive physiology as reference data.",Animal Bioscience,2022

Hara (Lamiaceae) is a traditional Chinese medicine plant that has been used to treat various human diseases. Oridonin is one of the main active ingredients, and the route of its molecular biosynthesis remains to be determined. The study of gene expression patterns can provide clues toward the understanding of its biological functions. The selection of suitable reference genes for normalizing target gene expression is the first steps in any quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) gene expression study. Therefore, validation of suitable reference genes is necessary for obtaining reliable results in RT-qPCR analyses of I. rubescens. Here, 12 candidate reference genes were chosen, and their expression stability in different tissues of I. rubescens and in leaves under different abiotic stresses (NaCl, dehydration, SA, MeJA, and ABA) was evaluated using the ∆Ct, NormFinder, GeNorm, BestKeeper, and RankAggreg statistical tools. Analysis using the comprehensive tools of RankAggreg algorithm showed that GADPH, 18S and eIF were stably expressed in different tissues; UBQ, Apt, and HIS; Cycl, UBQ, and PP2A; GADPH, 18S, and eIF; eIF, UBQ, and PP2A; TUB, Cycl, and UBQ; were the best three candidate reference genes for the samples of Dehydration, NaCl, SA, MeJA, and ABA treatment, respectively. While for the concatenated sets of ND (NaCl and dehydration) and SMA (SA, MeJA, and ABA), UBQ, HIS, and TUA; UBQ, eIF and Apt were the three appropriate candidate reference genes, respectively. In addition, the expression patterns of HMGR in different tissues and under different treatments were used to confirm the reliability of the selected reference genes, indicating that the use of an inappropriate reference gene as the internal control will cause results with a large deviation. This work is the first study on the expression stability of reference genes in I. rubescens and will be particularly useful for gene functional research in this species.",Scientific Reports,2022

To our knowledge, no reference gene(s) have been validated for this purpose in Clostridium perfringens. In this study, the expression profile of ten candidate reference genes from three strains of C. perfringens were assessed for stability under various experimental conditions using geNorm in qbase + . These stability rankings were then compared to stability assessments evaluated by BestKeeper, NormFinder, delta Ct, and RefFinder algorithms. When comparing all the analyses; gyrA, ftsZ, and recA were identified within the most stable genes under the different experimental conditions and were further tested as a set of reference genes for normalization of alpha toxin gene expression over a 22-h period. Depending on the condition, rpoA and rho might also be suitable to include as part of the reference set. Although commonly used for the purpose of normalizing RT-qPCR data, the 16S rRNA gene (rrs) was found to be an unsuitable gene to be used as a reference.

In this study, we evaluated reference genes for the lung in neonatal C57BL/6 mice under consideration of biological, technical and experimental conditions. For that, we thoroughly selected candidates from commonly used reference genes side-by-side with novel ones by analyzing publicly available microarray datasets. We performed RT-qPCR of the selected candidate genes and analyzed their expression variability using GeNorm and Normfinder. Cell-specific expression of the candidate genes was analyzed using our own single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the developing mouse lung.

Deer antlers are cranial appendages that regenerate annually in males. Throughout life, the phenology of antler growth advances and antler mass increases until the stag reaches, between 8 and 10 years old, maximum body mass and highest reproductive success. The molecular mechanisms of antler development are of great interest in both evolutionary and regenerative medicine studies. To minimize errors in the assessment of gene expression levels by qRT-PCR, we analyzed the stability of a panel of eight candidate reference genes and concluded that qRT-PCR normalization to three stable genes is strongly convenient in experiments performed in red deer antler blood. To validate our proposal, we compared the expression level of three genes linked to red deer antler growth (ANXA2, APOD and TPM1) in fifteen male red deer classified as young (up to 4 years old) and adults (4–6 years old). Our data confirms that B2M, ACTB and RPLP0 are valuable reference genes for future gene expression studies in red deer antler blood, which would provide increased insight into the effects of intrinsic factors that determine antler development in red deer.",Scientific Reports,2022

In different organs, gene expression patterns can provide clues to understanding the biological functions. For rapid and accurate quantification of gene expression, quantitative real‐time PCR (qPCR) has become one of the most widely used methods. However, the success of qPCR data normalization depends on the use of a suitable reference gene and a single reference gene is not universally suitable for all the experiments. Therefore, reference gene validation is a crucial step for different organ tissues of chicken where suitable reference genes for qPCR analysis in varieties of tissues have not been investigated exhaustively so far. In this study, we have selected 30 Gallus gallus candidate reference genes from NCBI, amplified and studied their expression profiles by qPCR in different organ tissues (breast muscle, thigh muscle, heart, liver, spleen, gizzard, and bursa) of chicken. The result showed that, for breast muscle HSP10 and RPL23, thigh muscle RPL14 and RPL13, liver ALB and HSP70, spleen ALB and GAPDH, heart CYCS and TUBA8B, gizzard RPL5 and 18S rRNA, and bursa EEF1A1 and PGK2 are most stable genes respectively. The results also showed that for different organ tissues, individual or a combination of reference genes should be selected for data normalization.

                Background
                Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) is a powerful tool to evaluate mRNA expression level. However, reliable qPCR results require normalization with validated reference gene(s). In this study, we investigated stable reference genes in seven tissues according to four developmental stages in minipigs. Six candidate reference genes and one target gene (ACE2) were selected and qPCR was performed. BestKeeper, geNorm, NormFinder, and delta Ct method through the RefFinder web-based tool were used to evaluate the stability of candidate reference genes. To verify the selected stable genes, relative expression of ACE2 was calculated and compared with each other.
              
                Results
                As a result, HPRT1 and 18S genes had lower SD value, while HMBS and GAPDH genes had higher SD value in all samples. Using statistical algorithms, HPRT1 was the most stable gene, followed by 18S, β-actin, B2M, GAPDH, and HMBS. In intestine, all candidate reference genes exhibited similar patterns of ACE2 gene expression over time, whereas in liver, lung, and kidney, gene expression pattern normalized with stable reference genes differed from those normalized with less stable genes. When normalized with the most stable genes, the expression levels of ACE2 in minipigs highly increased in intestine and kidney at PND28, which is consistent with the ACE2 expression pattern in humans.
              
                Conclusions
                We suggest that HPRT1 and 18S are good choices for analyzing all these samples across the seven tissues and four developmental stages. However, this study can be a reference literature for gene expression experiments using minipig because reference gene should be validated and chosen according to experimental conditions.

When eight common reference genes were examined, it was discovered that some of them not only lacked consistent expression but also had considerable expression variance. It is worth noting that while choosing a reference gene, the mean gene expression and its standard deviation should be carefully addressed. An equation was developed based on this, and it was used to perform statistical analysis on over 25,000 genes. According to the subtype of thyroid cancer and, of course, the target genes in this investigation, appropriate reference genes were proposed. The intuitive choice of GAPDH as a common reference gene caused a major shift in the quantitative expression data of target genes, inverting the relative expression values.

                Background
                Real-time quantitative PCR is a widely used method for gene expression analyses in various organisms. Its accuracy mainly relies on the correct selection of reference genes. Any experimental plan involving real-time PCR needs to evaluate the characteristics of the samples to be examined and the relative stability of reference genes. Most studies in mollusks rely on reference genes commonly used in vertebrates.
              
                Results
                In this study, we focused on the transcriptome of the bivalve mollusk Mytilus galloprovincialis in physiological state to identify suitable reference genes in several adult tissues. Candidate genes with highly stable expression across 51 RNA-seq datasets from multiple tissues were selected through genome-wide bioinformatics analysis. This approach led to the identification of three genes (Rpl14, Rpl32 and Rpl34), whose suitability was evaluated together with 7 other reference genes commonly reported in literature (Act, Cyp-A, Ef1α, Gapdh, 18S, 28S and Rps4). The stability analyses performed with geNorm, NormFinder and Bestkeeper identified specific either single or pairs of genes suitable as references for gene expression analyses in specific tissues and revealed the Act/Cyp-A pair as the most appropriate to analyze gene expression across different tissues.

                Mytilus galloprovincialis is a model system increasingly used in ecotoxicology and molecular studies. Our transcriptome-wide approach represents the first comprehensive investigation aimed at the identification of suitable reference genes for expression studies in this species.

                Background
                Quantitative RT-PCR is a valuable tool for assessing the gene expression in different human tissues, particularly due to its exceptional sensitivity, accuracy and reliability. However, the choice of adequate control for normalization is a crucial step, greatly affecting the results of all subsequent analyses. So far, only a few studies were focused on the selection of optimal reference genes in left ventricles of failing human hearts, leading to several disparities in experimental results focused on differential gene expression in this area. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to identify a set of suitable reference genes in normal and failing left ventricle tissues, which could increase the reliability of RT-qPCR-based studies in the future.
              
                Methods
                We analyzed the expression of 15 commonly used housekeeping genes (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, GUSB, HMBS, HPRT1, IPO8, PGK1, POLR2A, PPIA, RPLP0, TBP, TFRC, UBC and YWHAZ) in left ventricles of normal and failed hearts with two-step approach. In the first step, we excluded genes which are variantly expressed using ANOVA-based statistical method. Afterwards, the remaining genes were analyzed using geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper algorithms, together with delta Cq method. Finally, the geometric mean of gene rankings across all methods was calculated.
              
                Results
                Our analysis identified IPO8 and POLR2A as the most stably expressed genes, whereas ACTB and B2M were found to be expressed variantly, suggesting a potential role of these genes in the pathophysiological processes in failing human hearts.

Janik","AbstractThe algorithms commonly used to select the best stable reference gene in RT-qPCR data analysis have their limitations. We showed that simple selection of the reference gene or pair of genes with the lowest stability value from the pool of potential reference genes—a commonly used approach—is not sufficient to accurately and reliably normalize the target gene transcript and can lead to biologically incorrect conclusions. For reliable assessment of changes in a target gene expression level, we propose our innovative GenExpA software, which works in a manner independent of the experimental model and the normalizer used. GenExpA software selects the best reference by combining the NormFinder algorithm with progressive removal of the least stable gene from the candidate genes in a given experimental model and in the set of daughter models assigned to it. The reliability of references is validated based on the consistency of the statistical analyses of normalized target gene expression levels through all models, described by the coherence score (CS). The use of the CS value imparts a new quality to qPCR analysis because it clarifies how low the stability value of reference must be in order for biologically correct conclusions to be drawn. We tested our method on qPCR data for the B4GALT genes family in melanoma, which is characterized by a high mutation rate, and in melanocytes.

Herein, we utilized an acute house dust mite (HDM)-sensitization mouse model to evaluate the stability of 10 reference genes commonly used for qRT-PCR normalization using 5 unique algorithms: GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, RefFinder and Qbase+. Rn18s was determined as the most stable reference gene across all samples evaluated, and Actb, the least stable reference gene. Furthermore, CircWave analysis showed no diurnal variation in the expression pattern for Rn18s but Actb showed strong diurnal changes in the lungs of both PBS (control) and HDM groups. We demonstrate systematically how using Actb as a housekeeping gene offsets the diurnal expression patterns of the CCGs and leads to statistically significant results which may not be the true reflection of the qRT-PCR analysis.",Scientific Reports,2022

Understanding the biology of taimen (Hucho taimen) has drawn increasing interest because of its ecological and economic value. Stable reference genes are required for the reliable quantification of gene expression, but such genes have not yet been optimized for taimen. In this study, the stability levels of 10 commonly used candidate reference genes were evaluated using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. The expression levels of the 10 genes were detected using 240 samples from 48 experimental groups consisting of 40 individuals treated under four heat-stress conditions (18, 20, 22, and 24 °C) for 24 h and 26 °C for 4, 24, 48, and 72 h. Six tissues (blood, heart, brain, gill, skin, and liver) were collected from each individual. Ribosomal protein S29 (RPS29) and ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19) were the most stable genes among all of the samples, whereas 28S ribosomal RNA (28S rRNA), attachment region binding protein (ARBP), and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) were the least stable. These results were verified by an expression analysis of taimen heat-stress genes (heat shock protein 60, hsp60, and heat shock protein 70, hsp70). In conclusion, RPS29 and RPL19 are the optimal reference genes for qRT-PCR analyses of taimen, irrespective of the tissue and experimental conditions. These results allow the reliable study of gene expression in taimen.",Scientific Reports,2022

There is usually a large amount of BAT around the kidneys of newborn kids, but the BAT gradually “whiting” after birth. Screening and validating appropriate reference genes is a prerequisite for further studying the mechanism of goat brown adipose tissue “whiting” during the early stages. In this study, the expression stability of 17 candidate reference genes: 12 COPS8, SAP18, IGF2R, PARL, SNRNP200, ACTG1, CLTA, GANAB, GABARAP, PCBP2, CTSB, and CD151) selected based on previous transcriptome data as new candidate reference genes, 3 (PFDN5, CTNNB1, and EIF3M) recommended in previous studies, and 2 traditional reference genes (ACTB and GAPDH) was evaluated. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) technology was used to detect the expression level of candidate reference genes during goat BAT “whiting”. Four algorithms: Normfinder, geNorm, ΔCt method, and BestKeeper, and two comprehensive algorithms: ComprFinder and RefFinder, were used to analyze the stability of each candidate reference genes. GABARAP, CLTA, GAPDH, and ACTB were identified as the most stable reference genes, while CTNNB1, CTSB, and EIF3M were the least stable. Moreover, two randomly selected target genes IDH2 and RBP4, were effectively normalized using the selected most stable reference genes. These findings collectively suggest that GABARAP, CLTA, GAPDH, and ACTB are relatively stable reference genes that can potentially be used for the development of perirenal fat in goats.",Frontiers in Veterinary Science,2022

In order to better understand their molecular mechanisms, studies focusing on the genetic and molecular aspects of their development and behavior are needed. Although quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) can be used to quantify the relative expression of target genes, internal reference genes (which are stably expressed across different lines and tissues) must first be identified to ensure the accurate normalization of target genes. In order to contribute to molecular studies on bumble bees, we used Bombus terrestris to determine the expression stability of eight reference genes (β-actin (ACT), Arginine Kinase (AK), Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), Elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1), Ribosomal proteins (S5, S18, S28) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) in five different lines and several tissues (ovary, thorax, fat body, and head) using RT-qPCR procedures and four analysis programs (RefFinder, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and geNorm). In general, the S28, S5, and S18 ribosomal protein genes and the PLA2 and EF-1 genes showed the highest stability and were therefore identified as suitable reference genes for the bumble bee species and their defined lines and tissues.

The identification of the genes that respond to pesticide exposure based on their expression is essential for understanding the xenobiotic detoxification metabolism in honey bees. For the accurate determination of target gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR, the expression stability of reference genes should be validated in honey bees exposed to various pesticides. Therefore, in this study, to select the optimal reference genes, we analyzed the amplification efficiencies of five candidate reference genes (RPS5, RPS18, GAPDH, ARF1, and RAD1a) and their expression stability values using four programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) across samples of five body parts (head, thorax, gut, fat body, and carcass) from honey bees exposed to seven pesticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, flupyradifurone, fenitrothion, carbaryl, amitraz, and bifenthrin). Among these five candidate genes, a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 was suggested for target gene normalization. Subsequently, expression levels of six genes (AChE1, CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, CYP9Q3, CAT, and SOD1) were normalized with a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 in the different body parts from honey bees exposed to pesticides. Among the six genes in the five body parts, the expression of SOD1 in the head, fat body, and carcass was significantly induced by six pesticides.

(rosemary) is known to have a wide range of pharmacological effects including antidiabetic, anticarcinogenic, and antitumorigenic properties owing to its secondary metabolites. Studies aiming to elevate these metabolites have utilized various elicitors and stresses under in vitro conditions, although underlying molecular mechanisms remain unexplored. Gene expression studies using RT-qPCR might provide valuable information regarding how plant and plant cells interact and perceive various treatments and elicitors. However, despite being able to calculate accurate fold changes, the accuracy of the RT-qPCR data highly depends on the expression of reference genes. To the best of our knowledge, there is no information available on the stable reference genes in rosemary under in vitro conditions. Thus, in this paper, we assessed the stability of seven commonly used reference genes under different elicitor and stress conditions using RT-qPCR. Thereafter, the five most commonly used software and algorithms (comparative ΔCt, BestKeeper, NormFinder, geNorm, and RefFinder) were used to rank the candidates based on their expression stabilities. In conclusion, we recommend using a combination of F1-ATPase, ATP synthase and ACCase to normalize the gene expression experiments in rosemary under in vitro conditions. The selected reference genes were verified using 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, a pharmacologically important gene, whose expression might alter under nanoparticle treatment. Additionally, reference genes for several plant tissues, elicitors, and stresses are also proposed.

Therefore, choosing an appropriate reference gene is a critical step in normalizing qRT-PCR data. Prunella vulgaris L. is a traditional Chinese medicine herb widely used in China. Its main medicinal part is the fruiting spike which is termed Spica Prunellae. However, thus far, few studies have been conducted on the mechanism of Spica Prunellae development. Meanwhile, no reliable RGs have been reported in P. vulgaris. The expression levels of 14 candidate RGs were analyzed in this study in various organs and at different stages of Spica Prunellae development. Four statistical algorithms (Delta Ct, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and geNorm) were utilized to identify the RGs’ stability, and an integrated stability rating was generated via the RefFinder website online. The final ranking results revealed that eIF-2 was the most stable RG, whereas VAB2 was the least suitable as an RG. Furthermore, eIF-2 + Histon3.3 was identified as the best RG combination in different periods and the total samples. Finally, the expressions of the PvTAT and Pv4CL2 genes related to the regulation of rosmarinic acid synthesis in different organs were used to verify the stable and unstable RGs. The stable RGs in P. vulgaris were originally identified and verified in this work. This achievement provides strong support for obtaining a reliable qPCR analysis and lays the foundation for in-depth research on the developmental mechanism of Spica Prunellae.",Genes,2022

For the quantification of this and the effect of different factors affecting these processes, the expression levels of various maturation markers are determined using reverse transcription‐quantitative PCR. For this purpose, stably expressed reference genes are crucial. However, no studies evaluating the stability of reference genes in THP‐1 cells stimulated with LPS and IFN‐γ have been performed.

Using the RefFinder platform, including the four most popular algorithms for reference gene validation, the Delta CT, BestKeeper, NormFinder and geNorm, we find the reference genes GAPDH and UBC to be the most stable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the normalization of gene expression data using the least stable reference genes, ACTB and B2M, dramatically affects the interpretation of experimental data.

Previously, our RNA‐seq study showed that Hprt1, Actb, and 18S rRNA abundances were all significantly altered in porcine immature Sertoli cells (iSCs) during acute heat stress (HS). In the current study, we aimed to identify stable reference gene(s) to study the gene expression dynamics of quick and delayed responses after acute HS treatment of porcine iSCs. A total of six genes previously used in pig testis or Sertoli cells (Hprt1, Top2b, Actb, Rpl32, Gapdh, and 18S rRNA) were chosen to perform RT‐qPCR for the control (before acute HS), HS0.5 (acute HS at 43°C for 0.5 h), and HS0.5‐R36 (36 h recovery following acute HS) groups. The stability of candidate reference genes was examined by the GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and Comparative ΔCt methods, and RefFinder to obtain the final rank. Rpl32 and Actb were the two most stable internal reference genes as found by all methods, whereas Hprt1 and 18S rRNA were the two most unstable as ranked by RefFinder. Moreover, expression of six target mRNAs (Ccn1, Ccnb1, Eif4g1, Hdac6, Plk2, and Ptma) was normalized using Rpl32, Actb, or the combination of Rpl32 and Actb, respectively.

However, the use of appropriate reference genes is essential to attain meaningful RT-qPCR results. Anastatus japonicus Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Helicopteridae) is an important egg parasitoid wasp and natural enemy of fruit bugs and forest caterpillars. While recent transcriptomic studies have analyzed gene expression profiles in A. japonicus specimens, offering a robust foundation for functional research focused on this parasitoid, no validated A. japonicus reference genes have yet been established, hampering further research efforts. Accordingly, this study sought to address this issue by screening for the most stable internal reference genes in A. japonicus samples to permit reliable RT-qPCR analyses. The utility of eight candidate reference genes (ACTIN, TATA, GAPDH, TUB, RPL13, RPS6, EF1α, RPS3a) was assessed under four different conditions by comparing developmental stages (larvae, pupae, adults), tissues (abdomen, chest, head), sex (male or female adults), or diapause states (diapause induction for 25, 35, 45, or 55 days, or diapause termination). RefFinder was used to calculate gene stability based on the integration of four algorithms (BestKeeper, Normfinder, geNorm, and ΔCt method) to determine the optimal RT-qPCR reference gene. Based on this approach, RPS6 and RPL13 were found to be the most reliable reference genes when assessing different stages of development, while ACTIN and EF1α were optimal when comparing adults of different sexes, RPL13 and EF1α were optimal when analyzing different tissues, and TATA and ACTIN were optimal for different diapause states.

Nodal segment explants of the cultivar Duke were regenerated by organogenesis under different periods of colchicine 1 mg/L exposure (1, 2, 3, 5, 30 days). The clones selected for the study showed variability for phenotypic traits after 2 years of adaptation to field conditions, compared to plants of the donor genotype that were regenerated on a medium without colchicine. Vaccinium myrtillus (GAPDH) and Vaccinium macrocarpon (ATP1, NADH, RPOB and COX2) were used as reference genomes for primer design. The results show that colchicine treatments can cause genomic changes in blueberry plants. At the molecular level, exposure of plants to colchicine in early periods could promote an increase in gene expression of specific genes such as ATP1, COX2, GAPDH, MATK, NADH and RPOB. However, prolonged exposure (30 days) could decrease gene expression of the genes studied. For qPCR assays, the primers designed for ATP1, COX2, GAPDH and MATK genes showed high efficiency.

However, the accuracy of the quantitation is largely dependent on the stability of the expressions of reference genes used for normalization. Recently, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been widely used to mine stably expressed genes for use as references in RT-qPCR. However, the amplification step in RNA-seq creates an intrinsic bias against those genes with relatively low expression levels, and therefore does not provide an accurate quantification of all expressed genes. In this study, we employed mass spectrometry-based label-free quantification (LFQ) in proteomic analyses to identify those proteins with abundances unaffected by Pst DC3000 infection. We verified, using RT-qPCR, that the levels of their corresponding mRNAs were also unaffected by Pst DC3000 infection. Compared to commonly used reference genes for expression studies in A. thaliana upon Pst DC3000 infection, the candidate reference genes reported in this study generally have a higher expression stability. In addition, using RT-qPCR, we verified that the mRNAs of the candidate reference genes were stably expressed upon stress hormone treatments including JA, SA, and ABA. Results indicated that the candidate genes identified here had stable expressions upon these stresses and are suitable to be used as reference genes for RT-qPCR. Among the 18 candidate reference genes reported in this study, many of them had greater expression stability than the commonly used reference genes, such as ACT7, in previous studies. Here, besides proposing more appropriate reference genes for Arabidopsis expression studies, we also demonstrated the capacity of mass spectrometry-based LFQ to quantify protein abundance and the possibility to extend protein expression studies to the transcript level.",Frontiers in Plant Science,2022
10.3389/fgene.2022.827538,Investigation of chicken housekeeping genes using next-generation sequencing data,"Karim Hasanpur, Sevda Hosseinzadeh, Atiye Mirzaaghayi, Sadegh Alijani","Accurate normalization of the gene expression assays, using housekeeping genes (HKGs), is critically necessary. To do so, selection of a proper set of HKGs for a specific experiment is of great importance. Despite many studies, there is no consensus about the suitable set of HKGs for implementing in the quantitative real-time PCR analyses of chicken tissues. A limited number of HKGs have been widely used. However, wide utilization of a little number of HKGs for all tissues is challenging. The emergence of high-throughput gene expression RNA-seq data has enabled the simultaneous comparison of the stability of multiple HKGs. Therefore, employing the average coefficient of variations of at least three datasets per tissue, we sorted all reliably expressed genes (REGs; with FPKM ≥ 1 in at least one sample) and introduced the top 10 most suitable and stable reference genes for each of the 16 chicken tissues. We evaluated the consistency of the results of five tissues using the same methodology on other datasets. Furthermore, we assessed 96 previously widely used HKGs (WU-HKGs) in order to challenge the accuracy of the previous studies. The New Tuxedo software suite was used for the main analyses. The results revealed novel, different sets of reference genes for each of the tissues with 17 common genes among the top 10 genes lists of 16 tissues. The results did disprove the suitability of WU-HKGs such as Actb, Ldha, Scd, B2m, and Hprt1 for any of the tissues examined. On the contrary, a total of 6, 13, 14, 23, and 32 validated housekeeping genes (V-HKGs) were discovered as the most stable and suitable reference genes for muscle, spleen, liver, heart, and kidney tissues, respectively. Although we identified a few new HKGs usable for multiple tissues, the selection of suitable HKGs is required to be tissue specific. The newly introduced reference genes from the present study, despite lacking experimental validation, will be able to contribute to the more accurate normalization for future expression analysis of chicken genes.",Frontiers in Genetics,2022

To explore the function of the target genes of C. hemipterus, it is essential to select suitable reference genes for the accurate quantification of gene expression. Here, we selected 10 frequently used reference genes in insects and evaluated their stability in C. hemipterus under various biotic (developmental stage, sex, and tissue) and abiotic (gas stimulation and temperature) conditions through RefFinder (which integrates four computational programs: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and ∆Ct). Results indicate that the optimal combination of reference genes for each experimental condition was as follows: RPL8 and EF1α for the developmental stage (eggs, early instar nymphs, late instar nymphs, and adults), RPL8 and RPS16 for adult sex, RPL8 and RPL11 for adult tissue (head, thorax, abdomen, and legs), RPL8 and β-tubulin for gas stimulation (air and carbon dioxide), and RPL8 and NADH for temperature (0, 5, 17, 30, and 37 °C). Finally, the expression pattern of the HSP70 and GR21 genes were analyzed, and the results highlight the importance of appropriate reference-gene selection. Our results provide a comprehensive list of optimal reference genes from C. hemipterus for the first time, which will contribute to accurately analyzing the expression of target genes.",Insects,2022

We analyzed gene expression in hydrangeas sepals to study the causes of color change. The accuracy of quantitative RT-qPCR analysis depends on the reliability of reference genes. We selected reference genes for hydrangea of varying cultivars, at different developmental stages, and in aluminum treatment groups. We chose ‘Bailmer’ and ‘Duro’ as subject species. We selected eight candidate genes, all of which were ranked by geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. CCR, NHX1, and LODX were used to verify the exactitude of reference genes. According to the ranking result of RefFinder, the top-ranked reference genes in each group were different; the top four candidate reference genes in each group mostly included EF1-β, RPL34, GADPH, and RPL10. EF1-β and RPL34 ranked top in the ‘all materials’ group, and their expression trends, obtained from the analysis of CCR, NHX1, and LODX, were consistent. From the results, we gather that EF1-β and RPL34 can be used as reference genes to quantify target gene expression.

In this work, the optimal reference genes for RT‐qPCR normalisation in plasma samples of rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models were identified.MethodsSix rat MCAO models were established. Blood samples were collected before modelling and approximately 16–24 h after modelling. Two commonly used reference genes (U6 and 5S) and three miRNAs (miR‐24, miR‐122 and miR‐9a) were selected as candidate reference genes, and the expression of these genes was detected with RT‐qPCR. The acquired data were analysed using geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, RefFinder and comparative delta threshold cycle statistical models.ResultsThe analysed results consistently showed that miR‐24 was the most stably expressed reference gene. The ‘optimal combination’ calculated by geNorm was miR‐24, U6 and5S. The expression level of the target gene miR124 was similar when the most stable reference gene miR‐24 or the ‘optimal combination’ was used as a reference gene. However, compared with miR24 or the ‘optimal combination’, the less stable reference genes influenced the fold change and the data accuracy with a large standard deviation.ConclusionThese results confirmed the importance of selecting suitable reference genes for normalisation to obtain reliable results in RT‐qPCR studies and demonstrated that the identified reference gene miR‐24 or the ‘optimal combination’ could be used as an internal control for gene expression analysis in the rat MCAO model.",Veterinary Medicine and Science,2022

Studies have shown that Colletotrichum fructicola cause oil-tea (Camellia oleifera) anthracnose and is widely distributed as a dominant fungus in all Ca. oleifera-producing regions. Real-time quantitative PCR(RT-qPCR) is considered the most reliable technique for simultaneously measuring relative gene expression levels in different tissues. Target genes are typically quantified using RT-qPCR to explore gene function, and reliable RT-qPCR results require data normalization using stable reference genes. No studies have reported a suitable reference gene in C. fructicola. This study has eight candidate reference genes (CfCk, CfRpp, CfUce, CfRrp, CfAdrh, CfDd, CfAct, and CfTub) which were selected from C. fructicola-Ca. oleifera transcriptome data and evaluated and sequenced using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms.

Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has been utilized to study changes in gene expression associated with exposure to the HMF. However, selecting appropriate reference genes (RGs) with confirmed stable expression across environments for RT-qPCR is often underappreciated. Using three algorithms (BestKeeper, NormFinder, and GeNorm), we investigated the expression stability of eight candidate RGs when exposed to the HMF condition versus local GMF during developmental from juveniles to adults in the migratory insect pest, the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.

It is imperative to screen out appropriate reference genes during the interaction between G. yamadae and apple leaves to analyze the gene expression patterns during the pathogenesis of G. yamadae. ACT, EF1, EF2, GAPDH, 40S, 60S, α-TUB, β-TUB and UBCE3 were selected as candidate reference genes based on the transcriptomic dataset of G. yamadae. The expression levels were tested by real-time quantitative PCR during time-course infection of apple leaves and the expression stabilities were evaluated by △Ct method as well as by three software (NormFinder, geNorm and BestKeeper) and one web-based analysis software (RefFinder). The expression stability of the candidate reference genes was further validated by using the effector candidate gene Cluster-3395.48660 as the target gene in RT-qPCR. According to the results by △Ct and BestKeeper, 40S, EF2 and EF1 were the most stable reference genes, while EF1, EF2 and GAPDH were the most stable reference genes based on the NormFinder analysis result. The geNorm recommended the most stable genes EF1, EF2 and α-TUB as reference genes. Comprehensive analysis results of the RefFinder indicated EF1, EF2 and α-TUB were the most suitable genes. Based on these results, EF1, EF2 and α-TUB were considered as reference genes for analyzing the gene expression profiles of Cluster-3395.48660 in different infection stages, and the results were consistent with the transcriptome data.

The PWS-critical region (PWScr) harbors tandemly repeated non-protein coding IPW-A exons hosting the intronic SNORD116 snoRNA gene array that is predominantly expressed in brain. Paternal deletion of PWScr is associated with key PWS symptoms in humans and growth retardation in mice (PWScr model). Dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis (HPA) is thought to be causally involved in the PWS phenotype. Here we performed a comprehensive reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis across nine different brain regions of wild-type (WT) and PWScr mice to identify stably expressed reference genes. Four methods (Delta Ct, BestKeeper, Normfinder and Genorm) were applied to rank 11 selected reference gene candidates according to their expression stability. The resulting panel consists of the top three most stably expressed genes suitable for gene-expression profiling and comparative transcriptome analysis of WT and/or PWScr mouse brain regions.

In this study, to select reference genes showing consistent expression patterns regardless of the acaricide treatment or the type of tissue, Varroa mites treated with each of the three representative acaricides (coumaphos, fluvalinate, and amitraz) were processed for transcriptomic analysis, from which eight genes (NADH dehydrogenase [NADHD], glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH], eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 α 1 [eEF1A1], eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 [eEF2], ribosomal protein L5 [RpL5], Actin, tubulin α‐1D chain [α‐tubulin], and Rab1) were selected as candidates. The transcription profiles of these genes, depending on the treatment of the three acaricides or across different tissues (cuticle, legs, gut/fat bodies, and synganglion), were analyzed using qPCR with four validation programs, BestKeeper, geNorm, NormFinder, and RefFinder. Following acaricide treatment, eEF1A1 and NADHD showed the least variation in their expression levels, whereas the expression levels of α‐tubulin and RpL5 were the most stable across different tissue groups. Rab1/GAPDH and Actin/eEF2 showed the least stable expression patterns following acaricide treatments and across different tissues, respectively, requiring precautions for use. When vitellogenin gene expression was analyzed by different reference genes, its expression profiles varied significantly depending on the reference genes, highlighting the importance of proper reference gene use.

Iljinskaja is a special plant species grown at high elevation in southwestern China. The bark, leaves, and roots are used for many purposes including reduction of fever and enhancement of blood insulin level. However, its growth is usually limited by the fragile environment and climate variability. Previous studies attributed the environment‐relevant yield reductions to stress induced gene expression changes. The accuracy and reliability of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR), a commonly accepted gene expression method, depends on the choice of appropriate reference genes, which are used for gene expression normalization. However, there are no reports at present about reference genes of C. paliurus under environmental stresses. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify reference genes for C. paliurus under environmental stresses. In this work, we selected seven common reference genes as our candidates: ACT2, ACTF, GAPDH, TUA, TUB, UBQ4, and 18SrRNA. The stability of these seven reference genes in C. paliurus was quantified by RT‐qPCR and evaluated by geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. The results suggest that although there were variations of the stability of the internal reference genes, two of them were usually good enough for the normalization purpose for low temperature (4 °C), high salinity (NaCl), and drought stress (polyethylene glycol [PEG] treatment). However, these genes should not be used for high‐temperature (42 °C) stress. This study provides insight for reference gene selection under experimental stresses in C. paliurus. It also sets the foundation of wide and accurate use of RT‐qPCR under environmental stresses.",Agronomy Journal,2022

The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) molecular technique is most commonly used to determine mRNA expression changes in platelets. Accurate and reliable relative RT-qPCR is highly dependent on reliable reference genes. However, there is no study to validate the reference gene in platelets for pan-cancer. Given that the expression of some commonly used reference genes is altered in certain conditions, selecting and verifying the most suitable reference gene for pan-cancer in platelets is necessary to diagnose early stage cancer. This study performed bioinformatics and functional analysis from the RNA-seq of platelets data set (GSE68086). We generated 95 candidate reference genes after the primary bioinformatics step. Seven reference genes (YWHAZ, GNAS, GAPDH, OAZ1, PTMA, B2M, and ACTB) were screened out among the 95 candidate reference genes from the data set of the platelets’ transcriptome of pan-cancer and 73 commonly known reference genes. These candidate reference genes were verified by another platelets expression data set (GSE89843). Then, we used RT-qPCR to confirm the expression levels of these seven genes in pan-cancer patients and healthy individuals. These RT-qPCR results were analyzed using the internal stability analysis software programs (the comparative Delta CT method, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) to rank the candidate genes in the order of decreasing stability. By contrast, the GAPDH gene was stably and constitutively expressed at high levels in all the tested samples. Therefore, GAPDH was recommended as the most suitable reference gene for platelet transcript analysis. In conclusion, our result may play an essential part in establishing a molecular diagnostic platform based on the platelets to diagnose pan-cancer.",Frontiers in Genetics,2022

Stable reference genes play a foundational role during the normalization of gene expression levels. However, until now, there have been few reference genes suitable for ginger reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) research. In this study, 29 candidate reference genes with stable expression patterns across multiple ginger tissues and 13 commonly used reference genes were selected to design RT-qPCR primers. After amplification specificity validation, 32 candidates were selected and further evaluated by RT-qPCR using samples from various organs subjected to NaCl, drought, heat, waterlogging, and chilling stress. Four strategies, including delta-CT, BestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder, were used to rank the stability of reference genes, and the ranks produced by these four strategies were comprehensively evaluated by RefFinder to determine the final rank. Overall, the top three stability reference genes indicated by RefFinder were RBP &amp;gt; ATPase &amp;gt; 40S_S3. Their expression pattern correlation analysis showed that the coefficients among each pair of RBP, ATPase, and 40S_S3 were larger than 0.96, revealing consistent and stable expression patterns under various treatments. Then, the expression of three pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and seven MYB genes in rhizomes during postharvest storage and subjected to pathogen infection was normalized by RBP, ATPase, 40S_S3, RBP and ATPase, ATPase and 40S-S3, and RBP and 40S-S3. The results showed that PR and MYB genes were induced by postharvest deterioration and pathogen infection. The correlation coefficients of RBP/ATPase, RBP/40S_S3, ATPase/40S_S3, RBP and ATPase/ATPase and 40S-S3, RBP and ATPase/RBP and 40S-S3, and ATPase and 40S-S3/RBP and 40S-S3 were 0.99, 0.96, 0.99, 0.99, 1.00, and 1.00, respectively, which confirmed the stability of these three reference genes in postharvest biology studies of ginger.

Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV) is one of the most prevalent viruses, causing significant losses. Cucumissativus can be infected by several ilarviruses, leading to obvious symptoms, including PNRSV, which suggests that cucumbers could be good hosts for the study of the pathogenesis of ilarviruses. Real-time quantitative PCR is an optimal choice for studying gene expression because of its simplicity and its fast and high sensitivity, while its accuracy is highly dependent on the stability of the reference genes. In this study, we assessed the stability of eleven reference genes with geNorm, NormFinder, ΔCt method, BestKeeper, and the ranking software, RefFinder. The results indicated that the combined use of EF1α and F-BOX was the most accurate normalization method. In addition, the host genes AGO1, AGO4, and RDR6 were selected to test the reliability of the reference genes.

Glucocorticoid-induced gene expression studies may be useful to discriminate those obese asthmatic patients who present a poor response to glucocorticoids. The expression of genes of interest is normalized with respect to reference genes (RGs). Ideally, RGs have a stable expression in different samples and are not affected by experimental conditions. The objective of this work was to analyze suitable RGs to study the role of glucocorticoid-induced genes in obese asthmatic patients in further research. The gene expression of eight potential RGs (GUSB, B2M, POLR2A, PPIA, ACTB, GAPDH, HPRT1, and TBP) was assessed with reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from asthmatic, obese asthmatic, and healthy individuals. Their stability was analyzed using four different algorithms—BestKeeper, ΔCt, geNorm, and NormFinder. geNorm analysis recommended the use of a minimum of three genes for normalization. Moreover, intergroup variation due to the treatment was calculated by NormFinder, which found that B2M was the gene that was least affected by different treatments. Comprehensive rankings indicated GUSB and HPRT1 as the best RGs for qPCR in PBMCs from healthy and asthmatic subjects, while B2M and PPIA were the best for obese asthmatic subjects. Finally, our results demonstrated that B2M and HPRT1 were the most stable RGs among all groups, whereas ACTB, TBP, and GAPDH were the worst shared ones.",Methods and Protocols,2022

The main objective of current study was to select the optimal reference genes for data normalization by qPCR in the VBNC state of Xcc. In this study, Xcc was induced into VBNC state by Cu2+ with an initial concentration of OD600 = 0.18 and OD600 = 0.45, and all viable bacterial cells lost the culturability and entered into the VBNC state at 24 h and 48 h respectively. The concentration of VBNC cells was 3.3 × 107 cells/ml and 1.5 × 107 cells/ml respectively. Eight candidate reference genes (gyrB, pbpA, gapA, rpoB, tufA, 16S rRNA, ugpC and recA) were selected to assess the expression stability in the VBNC state of Xcc by four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, delta‐Ct and BestKeeper), while RefFinder was used to integrate the output from the four algorithms in fine. According to the algorithm analysis and validation of clpX expression analysis, the most suitable reference gene this study identified was the combination of ugpC and pbpA, and the least suitable gene was 16S rRNA in the Xcc VBNC state.

In studying the genetic underpinnings of insecticide resistance, the choice of stable reference genes for normalizing data plays a key role to acquire unbiased expression profile results from quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. Expression profiles of 11 selected reference genes were determined systematically in B. tabaci exposure to 11 insecticides. Furthermore, we assessed the stability of all the selected candidates in relation to other variables including sex, tissue type, and developmental stage. Candidate reference gene validation was conducted by analyzing the let-7-5p expression under various experimental treatments. Five programs BestKeeper, NormFinder, geNorm, △Ct, and RefFinder were applied to verify the accuracy of the selected candidates. Our results displayed that the best choices of the selected candidates for pymetrozine, sulfoxaflor, flonicamid, cyantraniliprole, afidopyropen, and deltamethrin treatment were miR-1-3p and miR-100-5p, U6 and miR-100-5p were best for chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid treatments, and U6 and miR-1-3p were best for flupyradifurone and β-cypermethrin treatments. The reference genes miR-624, miR-252, and miR-275 worked best in adult tissues, miR-100-5p and miR-1-3p worked best in either sex, and miR-624 and miR-11 were best to use across developmental stages. Not even one reference gene was found to be suitable for all experimental conditions. Our results contributed to the growing body of the literature on qPCR reference gene selection under various experimental conditions and facilitate further investigation on gene expression changes in B. tabaci, resulting from pesticide exposure.",Frontiers in Genetics,2022

In this study, the stability of seven housekeeping genes (including Actin, EF1A, α-tubulin, RPL13a, RPS18, RPL8 and UBC) was investigated under both biotic (developmental stages, tissues, sex and pathogen treatment) and abiotic (RNA interference treatment, temperature treatment) conditions. The geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and ΔCt programs were used to analyze gene expression data. The RefFinder synthesis analysis was applied to suggest a handful of appropriate reference genes for each experimental condition. RPS18 and EF1A were the most reliable reference genes in different development stages; RPS18 and RPL8 were most stable in female and male adults, different tissues, different temperatures, and pathogen treatment; α-tubulin and RPL13a were most stable after dietary RNAi treatment.

All selected reference genes showed a broad range of Ct values in all samples, which was supportive of their variable expression. Our results showed significant variation in the stable expression of K. paniculata genes. Sample data, analyzed using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, showed that phospholipase (PLA2) and β-actin (ACT) were the most suitable and statistically reliable reference genes, whereas ribosomal protein L13 (RPL13) and elongation factor 1-α (EF1α) were less stable and unsuitable for use as internal controls. To compare gene expression levels, two or more reference genes should be used for data normalization. Thus, the stability and expression of both PLA2 and ACT were believed to provide better normalization and quantification of the transcript levels for gene expression studies in K. paniculata.",Genes,2022

Various experimental paradigms require specific and stable RGs. In studies using rodent models of brain ischaemia, a variety of genes, such as β‐actin (Actb), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (Hprt1), peptidyl‐propyl isomerase A (Ppia) and glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), are used as RGs. However, most of these genes have not been validated in specific experimental settings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the time‐ and brain region‐dependent expression of RG candidates in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). The following genes were selected: Actb, Hprt1, Ppia, Gapdh, tyrosine 3‐monooxygenase/tryptophan 5‐monooxygenase activation protein, zeta (Ywhaz) and beta‐2 microglobulin (B2m). Focal cerebral ischaemia was induced by 90 min of tMCAO in male Sprague‐Dawley rats. Expression was investigated at four time points (12 and 24 h; 3 and 7 days) and in three brain areas (the frontal cortex, hippocampus and dorsal striatum) within the ischaemic brain hemisphere. The RT‐qPCR results were analysed using variance analysis and the ΔCt, GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper methods. Data from these algorithms were ranked using the geometric mean of ranks of each analysis. Ppia, Hprt1 and Ywhaz were the most stable genes across the analysed brain areas and time points.

PWN are attracted to the pupal chambers and then carried inside the trachea of beetle adults, which is a necessary part to complete the B. xylophilus infection cycle. The growth and immune responses of the vector beetle will affect this carrying process, however, they were rarely studied in Monochamus saltuarius. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), one of the most common methods for quantitative gene expression analysis, was performed to explore the key genes and pathways involved in the growth, development and immune responses of M. saltuarius at different developmental stages associated with infection of PWN and PWN treatment conditions. To enhance the accuracy of RT-qPCR data, the expression of target genes needs to be normalized with reference genes, which are stably expressed under varied experimental conditions. In our study, the stability of 14 candidate reference genes in M. saltuarius samples at different developmental stages associated with infection of PWN or PWN treatment conditions was evaluated using delta Ct, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder algorithms.

               Hawthorn spider mite, Amphitetranychus viennensis Zacher, one of the most damaging arthropod pests for Rosaceaous fruit trees and ornamentals, has developed resistance to most of the commercially available acaricides. To understand the molecular basis of acaricide resistance, a standardized protocol for real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) following the MIQE (minimum information for publication of quantitative real time PCR experiments) guidelines is needed. In this study, we screened for the internal references in A. viennensis to study in acaricide resistance. In total, 10 candidate reference genes, including EF1A, 28S rRNA, 18S rRNA, α-tubulin, Actin3, RPS9, GAPDH, V-ATPase B, RPL13, and V-ATPase A, were assessed under the treatments of four commonly used acaricides with distinct mode-of-actions (MOAs). Based on the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee MOA classification, avermectin, bifenazate, spirodiclofen, and fenpropathrin belong to group 6, 20D, 23, and 3A, respectively. The expression profiles of these candidate genes were evaluated using geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and ∆Ct methods, respectively. Eventually, different sets of reference genes were recommended for each acaricide according to RefFinder, a comprehensive platform integrating all four above-mentioned algorithms. Specifically, the top three recommendations were 1) 28S, V-ATPase A, and Actin 3 for avermectin, 2) GAPDH, RPS9, and 28S for bifenazate, 3) Actin 3, V-ATPase B, and α-tubulin for spirodiclofen, and 4) Actin 3, α-tubulin, and V-ATPase A for fenpropathrin. Although unique sets of genes are proposed for each acaricide, α-tubulin, EF1A, and GAPDH are the most consistently stably expressed reference genes when A. viennensis was challenged chemically. Our findings lay the foundation for the study of acaricide resistance in the phytophagous mites in general, and in the hawthorn spider mite, A. viennensis, in particular.",Journal of Economic Entomology,2022

               Metabolic detoxification is a common mechanism of insecticide resistance, in which detoxifying enzyme genes are overexpressed. Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is one of the major soybean pests in the United States and has developed resistance to pyrethroid insecticides after almost two decades of use. To date, there are no validated reference genes to normalize expression of detoxification genes for pyrethroid resistance in A. glycines. From a literature review, a list was compiled of genes from 36 gene families (68 sequences) frequently used as reference genes in gene expression analysis in Hemiptera. Exon–exon junction primers were designed for the best alignment matches to a draft A. glycines genome and were assayed in a three-phase screening. The first screen eliminated nonamplifying primers. The second screen used nine A. glycines populations varying in resistance to pyrethroids and eliminated primers with inconsistent amplification or low amplification efficiency, and quantitatively assessed the stability of expression in the 14 remaining candidates using NormFinder and a generalization of BestKeeper. The third screen quantitatively validated these results on the best candidates. Six genes were identified with the greatest stability across technical and biological replication and the nine populations. The genes identified as the most suitable reference genes for the study of detoxifying enzymes related to pyrethroid resistance in soybean aphid were: actin, RPL9 (ribosomal protein L9), RPS9 (ribosomal protein S9), AK (arginine kinase), RNAPol2 (RNA polymerase II), and RPL17 (ribosomal protein L17). Our findings will support studies related to insecticide resistance in A. glycines.",Journal of Entomological Science,2022

Bachmann","AbstractObjectiveTo underline the necessity of adequate reference genes for real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR) and evaluate a novel tool for condition‐specific reference gene selection.BackgroundRT‐qPCR is a commonly used experimental technique that allows for highly sensitive analysis of gene transcription. Moreover, the use of internal reference genes as a means for relative quantification has rendered RT‐qPCR a straightforward method for a variety of sciences, including dentistry. However, the expressional stability of internal reference genes must be evaluated for every assay in order to account for possible quantification bias.Materials and MethodsHerein, we used the software tool RefGenes to identify putatively stable reference genes with the help of microarray datasets and evaluated them. Additionally, we propose an evidence‐based workflow for adequate normalization of thusly identified genes. Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF‐hTert), human acute leukemia‐derived monocytes (THP‐1), and telomerase immortalized gingival keratinocytes (TIGKs) were subjected to set‐ups simulating various glycemic conditions and lipopolysaccharide challenges. Five common housekeeping genes (HKGs) and five genes from RefGenes were selected as targets and RT‐qPCR was performed subsequently. Then, normalization algorithms Bestkeeper, Normfinder, and geNorm were used for further analysis of the putative reference gene stability.ResultsRefGenes‐derived targets exhibited the highest stability values in THP‐1 and TIGK cell lines. Moreover, unacceptable standard variations were observed for some common HKG like β‐actin. However, common HKG exhibited good stability values in HGF‐hTert cells.ConclusionThe results indicate that microarray‐based preselection of putative reference genes is a valuable refinement for RT‐qPCR studies. Accordingly, the present study proposes a straightforward workflow for evidence‐based preselection and validation of internal reference genes.",Clinical and Experimental Dental Research,2022

Markulin","ABSTRACTIncreases in environmental temperature are directly linked to the issue of climate change and are known to significantly disrupt plant growth and development. Studies of gene expression in plants commonly include RT‐qPCR but the reliability of the method depends on the use of suitable reference genes for data normalization. Despite this, no reference genes have been validated specifically for experiments inArabidopsis thalianaemploying treatments with elevated temperature.Here, ten genes were selected for expression stability analysis based on the screening of available literature and microarray data from temperature‐treatedA. thaliana. Expression levels of candidate reference genes were measured in 12‐day‐old seedlings, rosette leaves and flower buds of 5‐week‐oldA. thalianaplants exposed to five different temperatures (22°C, 27°C, 32°C, 37°C and 42°C) and their expression stabilities were assessed using four statistical algorithms (BestKeeper, geNorm, NormFinder and comparative ΔCqmethod).This study provides reliable reference genes for use inA. thalianaRT‐qPCR expression analyses employing elevated temperature treatments, namelyOGIOandPUX7in seedlings,UBC21andPUX7in leaves,TIP41andUBC21in buds, andTIP41andUBC21in all three tissues combined.Orthologues of these genes can be of potential use in less studied plants, especially agricultural species heavily affected by climate change.",Plant Biology,2022

It is noteworthy that housekeeping genes commonly used in adult studies may not be applicable for fetus. However, the stability analysis of housekeeping gene in fetal kidney has not been reported. This study intends to screen the applicable compound housekeeping genes in rat fetal kidney. In this study, eight housekeeping genes used in kidney studies based on literature reports (GAPDH, ACTB, 18S, HPRT, YWHAZ, HMBS, PPIA, and TBP) were selected as the research object. Their expression levels in the rat fetal kidney in physiological condition and the intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) model induced by prenatal dexamethasone exposure (PDE) (0.2 mg/kg·day from gestation Days 9 to 20) was measured. Furthermore, these eight housekeeping genes were used to conduct relative quantitative analysis of nephrin expression in the fetal kidney in PDE‐induced IUGR model, to compare the influence of choosing different housekeeping gene on data analysis of nephrin expression and to verify the reliability of selected compound housekeeping genes. In this study, stable housekeeping genes of fetal kidney tissues in PDE‐induced IUGR model were identified: ACTB, GAPDH, TBP, and HMBS for males; ACTB, YWHAZ, and GAPDH for females. Besides, our results suggest that ACTB + GAPDH were the best compound housekeeping genes for normalization analysis in male fetal kidney studies, and ACTB + YWHAZ in females. This study will provide an experimental evidence basis for the selection of housekeeping genes in the RT‐qPCR experiment in renal development toxicology‐related models.",Journal of Applied Toxicology,2021

Due to the interests in disclosing the genetic and epigenetic regulation mechanisms underlying the distinct developmental trajectories between castes and division of labor in colonies, many ant species have recently been established as laboratory models for evolutionary development and social behavior studies. These functional studies often request a precise quantification of the relative gene expression level, which relies on a stably expressed reference genes for normalization. A core set of reliable reference genes for this purpose however has not been established yet in ants. In the present study, we tested the expression patterns and amplification efficiencies of 12 abundantly expressed candidate genes in Monomorium pharaonis, one of the few ant species that are suitable for laboratory rearing and experimentation. We quantified the expression levels of these genes by RT-qPCR in seven different conditions: embryo development, sexual development, worker development, adult phenotypes, tissues, and two abiotic manipulative treatments in pharaoh ant. Finally, five genes, elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1A), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), TATA-box-binding protein (TATA), tubulin gamma-2 chain-like (TBLg2), heat shock protein 67B2-like (HSP67) were found to be the most stable reference genes across seven conditions. We also identified the most stable reference genes applicable for each distinct condition and the optimal number of reference genes entailed were evaluated.

No studies on the reference genes of Athetis dissimilis, an important agricultural pest, have been reported. In order to determine the reference genes for qRT-PCR normalization in A. dissimilis under different conditions, 10 candidate genes [18S ribosomal protein (18S), 28S ribosomal protein (28S), arginine kinase (AK), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1-α), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal protein L32 (RPL32), ribosomal protein L40 (RPL40), alpha-tubulin (α-TUB), beta-actin (β-ACT), and beta-tubulin (β-TUB)] of A. dissimilis were selected to evaluate their stability as reference genes under different biotic and abiotic conditions by using five tools, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCt, and RefFinder. Furthermore, CSP1 and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were used as target genes to validate the candidate reference genes. The results showed that different reference genes were needed under different experimental conditions, among which, EF-1α, RPL40, and 18S are most suitable reference genes for studying genes related development stages of A. dissimilis, RPL40 and α-TUB for larval tissues, α-TUB and 28S for adult tissues, EF-1α and β-ACT for insecticidal treatments, β-ACT and 28S for temperature treatments, EF-1α and β-ACT for starvation treatments, RPL40 and 18S for dietary treatments, and 18S, 28S, and α-TUB for all the samples.

Mitchell","Assessment of differential gene expression by qPCR is heavily influenced by the choice of reference genes. Although numerous statistical approaches have been proposed to determine the best reference genes, they can give rise to conflicting results depending on experimental conditions. Hence, recent studies propose the use of RNA-Seq to identify stable genes followed by the application of different statistical approaches to determine the best set of reference genes for qPCR data normalization. In this study, however, we demonstrate that the statistical approach to determine the best reference genes from commonly used conventional candidates is more important than the preselection of ‘stable’ candidates from RNA-Seq data. Using a qPCR data normalization workflow that we have previously established; we show that qPCR data normalization using conventional reference genes render the same results as stable reference genes selected from RNA-Seq data. We validated these observations in two distinct cross-sectional experimental conditions involving human iPSC derived microglial cells and mouse sciatic nerves. These results taken together show that given a robust statistical approach for reference gene selection, stable genes selected from RNA-Seq data do not offer any significant advantage over commonly used reference genes for normalizing qPCR assays.",PLOS Computational Biology,2022

A total of four analytical tool packages, including geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder were employed to determine the most appropriate reference genes under each treatment condition. The results demonstrate that different reference genes should be used for normalization under different experimental treatments.

Both genetic and environmental inputs contribute to the wing polyphenism in aphids, an extreme form of phenotypic plasticity in which a single genotype produces discrete winged and wingless morphs. Validated reference genes are needed to accurately normalize temporal and spatial variation in gene expression estimates by RT-qPCR. In this research, the stability of 11 candidate reference genes selected from S. avenae transcriptomes was evaluated under an array of abiotic and biotic conditions relevant to wing development. RefFinder, a comprehensive software integrating rankings from delta Ct, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and geNorm, offered a series of reference genes for every experimental condition. Overall, helicase (HEL) and ubiquitin ribosomal protein S27A fusion protein (RpS27) are suited for most of the conditions examined in this study, although exceptions do exist. Specifically, NADH dehydrogenase (Ap-NADH) and 28S ribosomal RNA (28S) are recommended for insecticide and antibiotic treatments, while ribosomal RNA L14 (RPL14) and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S) are selected for density treatment, respectively.

This polyploid species involves four cytotypes (2×, 4×, 6× and 12×) with spatial and ecological segregation. The study of gene expression in polyploid species must be very rigorous because of the effects of duplications on gene regulation. In these cases, real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the most appropriate technique for determining the gene expression profile because of its high sensitivity. The relative quantification strategy using qPCR requires genes with stable expression, known as reference genes, for normalization. In this work, we evaluated the stability of 13 candidate genes to be considered reference genes in leaf and petal tissues in Dianthus broteri. Several statistical analyses were used to determine the most stable candidate genes: Bayesian analysis, network analysis based on equivalence tests, geNorm and BestKeeper algorithms. In the leaf tissue, the most stable candidate genes were TIP41, TIF5A, PP2A and SAMDC. Similarly, the most adequate reference genes were H3.1, TIP41, TIF5A and ACT7 in the petal tissue. Therefore, we suggest that the best reference genes to compare different ploidy levels for both tissues in D. broteri are TIP41 and TIF5A.",Plants,2022

Organophosphate (OP) and neonicotinoid insecticides are widely used chemical pesticides and play important roles in controlling B. odoriphaga. However, a strong selection pressure following repeated pesticide applications has led to the development of resistant populations of this insect. To understand the insecticide resistance mechanism in B. odoriphaga, gene expression analysis might be required. Appropriate reference gene selection is a critical prerequisite for gene expression studies, as the expression stability of reference genes can be affected by experimental conditions, resulting in biased or erroneous results. The present study shows the expression profile of nine commonly used reference genes [elongation factor 1α (EF-1α), actin2 (ACT), elongation factor 2α (EF-2α), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10), ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC), and α-tubulin (TUB)] was systematically analyzed under insecticide stress.

               Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a technique widely used to investigate the expression of genes. An appropriate reference gene (RG) is essential for RT-qPCR analysis to obtain accurate and reliable results. Caragana intermedia plays an important role in afforestation as a bush. However, due to the lack of appropriate RGs, the research on development-related genes is limited. In this study, the selection for suitable RGs of different organs at various development stages to normalize the results of RT-qPCR about development-related genes was performed. To test the expression stability across all samples, we used the software algorithms such as geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder to evaluate all the candidate RGs. Our results showed that CiEF1α was the most stable RG with little fluctuation among all samples. In addition, CiGAPDH in roots, CiSKIP1 in stems and leaves, and CiEF1α in different organs were selected as the most stable RGs. To confirm the applicability of the most stable RGs, the relative expression of CiWRKY17 was normalized using different candidate RGs.

In this study, by using different mathematical algorithms (Genorm, normFinder, BestKeeper and comparative ΔCt method) and the comprehensive ranking software (RefFinder), the stability of seventeen housekeeping genes were assessed in eleven tissues of the hybrid grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus ♀ × E. lanceolatus ♂). Results showed that the stability of housekeeping genes were various in different tissues and the newly identified housekeeping genes were likely more stable than that of commonly used. In conclusion, the expression stability of housekeeping genes showed a tissue-specific manner, and the conserved oligomeric Golgi complex subunit 5 (cog5) and peroxisomal biogenesis factor 14 (pex14) could be universally used as appropriate housekeeping genes across different tissues in hybrid grouper.

However, some genes may not be stably expressed across all experimental conditions. Thus, this study aimed to validate seven house-keeping genes for gene expression analysis in Bacillus siamensis 1021.
Materials and Methods: Strain 1021 was grown in potato dextrose broth, nutrient broth and mineral salt medium. Re- verse-transcription quantitative PCR was used to determine Cq values of seven reference genes including gyrA, gyrB, ssb and dnaB, rpsU, gat_Yqey and udp in these media. Expression stability of these genes was analyzed, using geNorm and Normfinder applications. The target gene ftsZ was used for assessment of the best candidate genes.
Results: Based on geNorm and Normfinder, ssb was the most-stably expressed gene, while udp was the least-stably ex- pressed gene. Pairwise variation indicated the combination of ssb, gyrA, gyrB and gatB_Yqey was suitable for the normal- ization of ftsZ expression. ftsZ expression in potato dextrose broth and mineral salt medium was higher than that in nutrient broth. In contrast, the normalization against udp resulted in an under- and overestimation of ftsZ expression in potato dextrose broth and mineral salt medium, respectively.
Conclusion: The combination of ssb, gyrA, gyrB and gatB_Yqey was the best candidate for normalization of target gene expression in B. siamensis 1021 in these media. This study emphasized the significance of reference gene validation for gene expression analysis and provided a guideline for future gene expression studies in B. siamensis.",Iranian Journal of Microbiology,2022

The cycle threshold (Ct) values of genes in different samples were compared and analyzed. Furthermore, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and geNorm software were used to evaluate the stability of each candidate reference gene. Analysis using geNorm showed that the expression levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and protein phosphatase 2A-2 (PP2A-2) were the most stable. In turn, the expression level of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (EIF-4A-2) was the most stable as per analysis by NormFinder, while Bestkeeper revealed that actin-related protein-1 (ARP-1) was the most stably expressed.

Currently, the molecular physiological role of reference genes in H. cunea is unclear, which hinders functional gene study. Therefore, eight common reference genes, RPS26, RPL13, UBI, AK, RPS15, EIF4A, β-actin, α-tub, were selected to evaluate levels of gene expression stability when subjected to varied experimental conditions, including developmental stage and gender, different tissues, larvae reared on different hosts and different larval density.

However, the most suitable reference gene for different genotypes and tobacco rattle virus (TRV) infected fruits was unclear in peach (Prunus persica L. Batsch). In this study, 10 reference genes were selected and gene expression was characterized by RT-qPCR across all samples, including different genotypes and TRV-infected fruits during ripening. Four statistical algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) were used to calculate the stability of 10 reference genes. The geNorm analysis indicated that two suitable reference genes should be used for gene expression normalization. In general, the best combination of reference genes was CYP2 and Tua5 for TRV-infected fruits and CYP2 and Tub1 for different genotypes. In 18S, GADPH, and TEF2, there is an unacceptable variability of gene expression in all experimental conditions. Furthermore, to confirm the validity of the reference genes, the expression levels of PpACO1, PpEIN2, and PpPL were normalized at different fruit storage periods.

Despite the fact that reference gene (RG) expression stability has been validated in oocytes and other ovarian cells from several animal species, the suitability of a single universal RG in the different human ovarian cells and tissues has not been determined. The present study aimed to validate the expression stability of five of the most used RGs in human oocytes, cumulus cells, preantral follicles, ovarian medulla, and ovarian cortex tissue. The selected genes were glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), large ribosomal protein P0 (RPLP0), beta-actin (ACTB), and peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA). Overall, the stability of all RGs differed among ovarian cell types and tissues. NormFinder identified ACTB as the best RG for oocytes and cumulus cells, and B2M for medulla tissue and isolated follicles. The combination of two RGs only marginally increased the stability, indicating that using a single validated RG would be sufficient when the available testing material is limited. For the ovarian cortex, depending on culture conditions, GAPDH or ACTB were found to be the most stable genes. Our results highlight the importance of assessing RGs for each cell type or tissue when performing RT-qPCR analysis.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2022

Anthocyanins and carotenoids contribute to the red and yellow colors, respectively. In this study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is used to analyze the expression profiles of anthocyanin and carotenoids biosynthesis genes in Cymbidium lowianum (Rchb.f.) Rchb.f. Appropriate reference gene selection and validation are required before normalization of gene expression in qRT-PCR analysis. Thus, we firstly selected 12 candidate reference genes from transcriptome data, and used geNorm and Normfinder to evaluate their expression stability in lip (divided into abaxial and adaxial), petal, and sepal of the bud and flower of C. lowianum. Our results show that the two most stable reference genes in different tissues of C. lowianum bud and flower are EF1δ and 60S, the most unstable reference gene is 26S. The expression profiles of the CHS and BCH genes were similar to FPKM value profiles after normalization to the two most stable reference genes, EF1δ and 60S, with the upregulated CHS and BCH expression in flower stage, indicating that the ABP and CBP were activated across the stages of flower development. However, when the most unstable reference gene, 26S, was used to normalize the qRT-PCR data, the expression profiles of CHS and BCH differed from FPKM value profiles, indicating the necessity of selecting stable reference genes. Moreover, CHS and BCH expression was highest in the abaxial lip and adaxial lip, respectively, indicating that the ABP and CBP were activated in abaxial and adaxial lip, respectively, resulting in a presence of red or yellow segments in abaxial and adaxial lip. This study is the first to provide reference genes in C. lowianum, and also provide useful information for studies that aim to understand the molecular mechanisms of flower color formation in C. lowianum.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2022

Analysis of gene expression is frequently used for this purpose. Therefore, mRNA expression needs to be normalized through comparison to reference genes. In this study, we establish which of the usually reported reference genes is the most reliable one in cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). ACTB, TFRC, HPRT1 and TBP expression was quantified in 123 FFPE samples (74 MM and 49 CSCC biopsies) using qPCR. Expression stability was analysed by NormFinder and Bestkeeper softwares, and the direct comparison method between means and SD. The in-silico analysis with BestKeeper indicated that HPRT1 was more stable than ACTB and TFRC in MM (1.85 vs. 2.15) and CSCC tissues (2.09 vs. 2.33). The best option to NormFinder was ACTB gene (0.56) in MM and TFRC (0.26) in CSCC. The direct comparison method showed lower SD means of ACTB expression in MM (1.17) and TFRC expression in CSCC samples (1.00). When analysing the combination of two reference genes for improving stability, NormFinder indicated HPRT1 and ACTB to be the best for MM samples, and HPRT1 and TFRC genes for CSCC. In conclusion, HPRT1 and ACTB genes in combination are the most appropriate choice for normalization in gene expression studies in MM FFPE tissue, while the combination of HPRT1 and TFRC genes are the best option in analysing CSCC FFPE samples. These may be used consistently in forthcoming studies on gene expression in both tumours.",Current Issues in Molecular Biology,2021

The best option is to use a reference gene whose expression level is stable across various experimental conditions to compare the mRNA levels of a target gene. However, there is limited information on how the reference gene is differentially expressed at different ages (growth) in small invertebrates with notable changes such as molting. In this study, expression profiles of nine candidate reference genes from the brackish water flea, Diaphanosoma celebensis, were evaluated under diverse exposure to toxicants and according to growth. As a result, four different algorithms showed similar stabilities of genes for chemical exposures in the case of limited conditions using the same developmental stage (H2A was stable, whereas Act was fairly unstable in adults), while the results according to age showed a significantly different pattern in suite of candidate reference genes. This affected the results of genes EcRA and GST, which are involved in development and detoxification mechanisms, respectively.

10.1371/journal.pone.0260902,Identification of the best housekeeping gene for RT-qPCR analysis of human pancreatic organoids,"Alessandro Cherubini, Francesco Rusconi, Lorenza Lazzari","In the last few years, there has been a considerable increase in the use of organoids, which is a new three-dimensional culture technology applied in scientific research. The main reasons for their extensive use are their plasticity and multiple applications, including in regenerative medicine and the screening of new drugs. The aim of this study was to better understand these structures by focusing on the choice of the best housekeeping gene (HKG) to perform accurate molecular analysis on such a heterogeneous system. This feature should not be underestimated because the inappropriate use of a HKG can lead to misleading data and incorrect results, especially when the subject of the study is innovative and not totally explored like organoids. We focused our attention on the newly described human pancreatic organoids (hPOs) and compared 12 well-known HKGs (ACTB, B2M, EF1α, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT, PPIA, RNA18S, RPL13A TBP, UBC and YWHAZ). Four different statistical algorithms (NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper and ΔCt) were applied to estimate the expression stability of each HKG, and RefFinder was used to identify the most suitable genes for RT-qPCR data normalization. Our results showed that the intragroup and intergroup comparisons could influence the best choice of the HKG, making clear that the identification of a stable reference gene for accurate and reproducible RT-qPCR data normalization remains a critical issue. In summary, this is the first report on HKGs in human organoids, and this work provides a strong basis to pave the way for further gene analysis in hPOs.",PLOS ONE,2021

Biotic and abiotic disturbances weaken trees, creating breeding substrate that promotes rapid population growth. Management historically relied on silvicultural practices, but as forests become increasingly stressed, innovative management is needed. Manipulation of the cellular RNA interference (RNAi) pathway to induce gene silencing is an emerging means of insect suppression, and is effective for some bark beetles. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a powerful tool for analysis of gene expression, and is essential for examining RNAi. To compare gene expression among individuals, stably expressed reference genes must be validated for qPCR. We evaluated six candidate reference genes (18s, 16s, 28s, ef1a, cad, coi) for stability under biotic (beetle sex, developmental stage, and host plant), and abiotic (temperature, photoperiod, and dsRNA exposure) conditions. We used the comprehensive RefFinder tool to compare stability rankings across four algorithms. These algorithms identified 18s, 16s, and 28s as the most stably expressed. Overall, 16s and 28s were selected as reference genes due to their stability and moderate expression levels, and can be used for I. calligraphus gene expression studies using qPCR, including those evaluating RNAi.",Scientific Reports,2021

RPL32 in B. germanica and EF1α in P. americana showed the overall lowest variation among all examined samples. Based on the stability rankings by RefFinder, the optimal but varied reference genes under specific conditions were selected for qPCR normalization. In addition, the combination of RPL32 and EF1α was recommended for all the tested tissues and stages in B. germanica, whereas the combination of multiple reference genes was unfavorable in P. americana.

It could have been shown that microRNAs (miRs) play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of podocyte-associated kidney diseases. Due to their fully functioning pronephric kidney, larval zebrafish have become a popular vertebrate model, to study kidney diseases in vivo. Unfortunately, there is no consensus about a proper normalization strategy of RT-qPCR-based miRNA expression data in zebrafish.

Senevirathna, Ryo Yonezawa, Taiki Saka, Yoji Igarashi, Noriko Funasaka, Kazutoshi Yoshitake, Shigeharu Kinoshita, Shuichi Asakawa","AbstractToothed whales are one group of marine mammals that has developed special adaptations, such as echolocation for predation, to successfully live in a dynamic aquatic environment. Their fat metabolism may differ from that of other mammals because toothed whales have acoustic fats. Gene expression in the metabolic pathways of animals can change with respect to their evolution and environment. A real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR) is a reliable technique for studying the relative expressions of genes. However, since the accuracy of RT‐qPCR data is totally dependent on the reference gene, the selection of the reference gene is an essential step. In this study, 10 candidate reference genes (ZC3H10, FTL, LGALS1, RPL27, GAPDH, FTH1, DCN, TCTP, NDUS5, and UBIM) were initially tested for amplification efficiency using RT‐qPCR. After excluding DCN, the remaining nine genes, which are nearly 100% efficient, were selected for the gene stability analysis. Stable reference genes across eight different fat tissue, liver, and muscle samples from Grampus griseus were identified by four algorithms, which were provided in Genorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and Delta CT. Finally, a RefFinder comprehensive ranking was performed based on the stability values, and the nine genes were ranked as follows: LGALS1 &gt; FTL &gt; GAPDH &gt; ZC3H10 &gt; FTH1 &gt; NDUS5 &gt; TCTP &gt; RPL27 &gt; UBIM. The LGALS1 and FTL genes were identified as the most stable novel reference genes. The third‐ranked gene, GAPDH, is a well‐known housekeeping gene for mammals.

                Background
                Grapevine, as an essential fruit crop with high economic values, has been the focus of molecular studies in diverse areas. Two challenges exist in the grapevine research field: (i) the lack of a rapid, user-friendly and effective RNA isolation protocol for mature dark-skinned berries and, (ii) the lack of validated reference genes that are stable for quantification of gene expression across desired experimental conditions. Successful isolation of RNA with sufficient yield and quality is essential for downstream analyses involving nucleic acids. However, ripe berries of dark-skinned grape cultivars are notoriously challenging in RNA isolation due to high contents of polyphenolics, polysaccharides, RNase and water.
              
                Results
                We have optimized an RNA isolation protocol through modulating two factors at the lysis step that could impact results of RNA isolation - 2-ME concentration and berry mass. By finding the optimal combination among the two factors, our refined protocol was highly effective in isolating total RNA with high yield and quality from whole mature berries of an array of dark-skinned wine grape cultivars. Our protocol takes a much shorter time to complete, is highly effective, and eliminates the requirement for hazardous organic solvents. We have also shown that the resulting RNA preps were suitable for multiple downstream analyses, including the detection of viruses and amplification of grapevine genes using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), gene expression analysis via quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), and RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq). By using RNA-Seq data derived from Cabernet Franc, we have identified seven novel reference gene candidates (CYSP, NDUFS8, YLS8, EIF5A2, Gluc, GDT1, and EF-Hand) with stable expression across two tissue types, three developmental stages and status of infection with grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3). We evaluated the stability of these candidate genes together with two conventional reference genes (actin and NAD5) using geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. We found that the novel reference gene candidates outperformed both actin and NAD5. The three most stable reference genes were CYSP, NDUFS8 and YSL8, whereas actin and NAD5 were among the least stable. We further tested if there would be a difference in RT-qPCR quantification results when the most stable (CYSP) and the least stable (actin and NAD5) genes were used for normalization. We concluded that both actin and NAD5 led to erroneous RT-qPCR results in determining the statistical significance and fold-change values of gene expressional change.
              
                Conclusions
                We have formulated a rapid, safe and highly effective protocol for isolating RNA from recalcitrant berry tissue of wine grapes. The resulting RNA is of high quality and suitable for RT-qPCR and RNA-Seq. We have identified and validated a set of novel reference genes based on RNA-Seq dataset. We have shown that these new reference genes are superior over actin and NAD5, two of the conventional reference genes commonly used in early studies.

We aimed to identify genes characterized with low expression variability among human cancer and normal cell lines. For this purpose, we investigated the expression of 12 candidate reference genes in 13 widely used human cancer cell lines (HeLa, MCF-7, A-549, K-562, HL-60(TB), HT-29, MDA-MB-231, HCT 116, U-937, SH-SY5Y, U-251MG, MOLT-4 and RPMI-8226) and, in addition, 7 normal cell lines (HEK293, MRC-5, HUVEC/TERT2, HMEC, HFF-1, HUES 9, XCL-1). In our set of genes, we included SNW1 and CNOT4 as novel candidate reference genes based on the RNA HPA cell line gene data from The Human Protein Atlas. HNRNPL and PCBP1 were also included along with the „classical” reference genes ACTB, GAPDH, IPO8, PPIA, PUM1, RPL30, TBP and UBC. Results were evaluated using GeNorm, NormFiner, BestKeeper and the Comparative ΔCt methods. In conclusion, we propose IPO8, PUM1, HNRNPL, SNW1 and CNOT4 as stable reference genes for comparing gene expression between different cell lines.

                Background
                Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a reliable and efficient method for quantitation of gene expression. Due to the increased use of qPCR in examining nutrient-gene interactions, it is important to examine, develop, and utilize standardized approaches for data analyses and interpretation. A common method used to normalize expression data involves the use of reference genes (RG) to determine relative mRNA abundance. When calculating the relative abundance, the selection of RG can influence experimental results and has the potential to skew data interpretation. Although common RG may be used for normalization, often little consideration is given to the suitability of RG selection for an experimental condition or between various tissue or cell types. In the current study, we examined the stability of gene expression using BestKeeper, comparative delta quantitation cycle, NormFinder, and RefFinder in a variety of tissues obtained from iron-deficient and pair-fed iron-replete rats to determine the optimal selection among ten candidate RG.
              
                Results
                Our results suggest that several commonly used RG (e.g., Actb and Gapdh) exhibit less stability compared to other candidate RG (e.g., Rpl19 and Rps29) in both iron-deficient and iron-replete pair-fed conditions. For all evaluated RG, Tfrc expression significantly increased in iron-deficient animal livers compared to the iron-replete pair-fed controls; however, the relative induction varied nearly 4-fold between the most suitable (Rpl19) and least suitable (Gapdh) RG.
              
                Conclusion
                These results indicate the selection and use of RG should be empirically determined and RG selection may vary across experimental conditions and biological tissues.

In our study, 11 candidate reference genes were selected from the existing transcriptome data of Angelica decursiva. Here, four different types of statistical algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and Delta Ct) were used to calculate and evaluate the stability of gene expression under different external treatments. Subsequently, RefFinder analysis was used to determine the geometric average of each candidate gene ranking, and to perform comprehensive index ranking. The obtained results showed that among all the 11 candidate reference genes, SAND family protein (SAND), protein phosphatase 2A gene (PP2A), and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP) were the most stable reference genes, where Nuclear cap binding protein 2 (NCBP2), TIP41-like protein (TIP41), and Beta-6-tubulin (TUBA) were the least stable genes.

                Background
                Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a widely-used standard assay for assessing gene expression. RT-qPCR data requires reference genes for normalization to make the results comparable. Therefore, the selected reference gene should be highly stable in its expression throughout the experimental datasets. So far, reports about the optimal set of reference genes in murine left ventricle (LV) across embryonic and postnatal stages are few. The objective of our research was to identify the appropriate reference genes in murine LV among different developmental stages.
              
                Methods
                We investigated the gene expression profiles of 21 widely used housekeeping genes in murine LV from 7 different developmental stages (almost throughout the whole period of the mouse lifespan). The stabilities of the potential reference genes were evaluated by five methods: GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, Delta-Ct and RefFinder.
              
                Results
                We proposed a set of reliable reference genes for normalization of RT-qPCR experimental data in different conditions. Furthermore, our results showed that 6 genes (18S, Hmbs, Ubc, Psmb4, Tfrc and Actb) are not recommended to be used as reference genes in murine LV development studies. The data also suggested that the Rplp0 gene might serve as an optimal reference gene in gene expression analysis.
              
                Conclusions
                Our study investigated the expression stability of the commonly used reference genes in process of LV development and maturation. We proposed a set of optimal reference genes that are suitable for accurate normalization of RT-qPCR data in specific conditions. Our findings may be helpful in future studies for investigating the gene expression patterns and mechanism of mammalian heart development.

No systematic study for selecting appropriate reference genes for usage in RT-qPCR experiments comparing gene expression levels at different Schistosoma mansoni life-cycle stages has been performed. Most studies rely on genes commonly used in other organisms, such as actin, tubulin, and GAPDH. Therefore, the present study focused on identifying reference genes suitable for RT-qPCR assays across six S. mansoni developmental stages. The expression levels of 25 novel candidates that we selected based on the analysis of public RNA-Seq datasets, along with eight commonly used reference genes, were systematically tested by RT-qPCR across six developmental stages of S. mansoni (eggs, miracidia, cercariae, schistosomula, adult males and adult females). The stability of genes was evaluated with geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder algorithms. The least stable candidate reference genes tested were actin, tubulin and GAPDH. The two most stable reference genes suitable for RT-qPCR normalization were Smp_101310 (Histone H4 transcription factor) and Smp_196510 (Ubiquitin recognition factor in ER-associated degradation protein 1). Performance of these two genes as normalizers was successfully evaluated with females maintained unpaired or paired to males in culture for 8 days, or with worm pairs exposed for 16 days to double-stranded RNAs to silence a protein-coding gene.

Vora, Joel S. Parker, Jennifer Lucia Winkler, Angela Rösen-Wolff, Stefan Winkler","Abstract
                Background
                Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, but research efforts in neonatology are complicated due to the unavailability of large volume blood samples. Whole blood assays can be used to overcome this problem by performing both functional and gene expression studies using small amounts of blood. Gene expression studies using RT-qPCR estimate mRNA-levels of target genes normalized to reference genes. The goal of this study was to identify and validate stable reference genes applicable to cord blood samples obtained from developing neonates of different gestational age groups as well as to adult peripheral blood samples. Eight reference gene candidates (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT, PPIB, RPLP0, RPL13) were analyzed using the three published software algorithms Bestkeeper, GeNorm and NormFinder.
              
                Results
                A normalization factor consisting of ACTB and PPIB allows for comparative expression analyses of neonatal samples from different gestational age groups. Normalization factors consisting of GAPDH and PPIB or ACTB and GAPDH are suitable when samples from preterm and full-term neonates and adults are compared. However, all candidate reference genes except RPLP0 exhibited significant intergroup gene expression variance and a higher gene expression towards an older age which resulted in a small but statistically significant systematic bias. Systematic analysis of RNA-seq data revealed new reference gene candidates with potentially superior stability.
              
                Conclusions
                The current study identified suitable normalization factors and proposed the use of the additional single gene RPLP0 to avoid systematic bias. This combination will enable comparative analyses not only between neonates of different gestational ages, but also between neonates and adults, as it facilitates more detailed investigations of developmental gene expression changes. The use of software algorithms did not prevent unintended systematic bias. This generally highlights the need for careful validation of such results to prevent false interpretation of potential age-dependent changes in gene expression. To identify the most stable reference genes in the future, RNA-seq based global approaches are recommended.

                Background
                Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) remains one of the best-established techniques to assess gene expression patterns. However, appropriate reference gene(s) selection remains a critical and challenging subject in which inappropriate reference gene selction can distort results leading to false interpretations. To date, mixed opinions still exist in how to choose the most optimal reference gene sets in accodrance to the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guideline. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate which schemes were the most feasible for the identification of reference genes in a bone and cartilage bioengineering experimental setting. In this study, rat bone mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs), skeletal muscle tissue and adipose tissue were utilized, undergoing either chondrogenic or osteogenic induction, to investigate the optimal reference gene set identification scheme that would subsequently ensure stable and accurate interpretation of gene expression in bone and cartilage bioengineering.
              
                Results
                The stability and pairwise variance of eight candidate reference genes were analyzed using geNorm. The V0.15- vs. Vmin-based normalization scheme in rBMSCs had no significant effect on the eventual normalization of target genes. In terms of the muscle tissue, the results of the correlation of NF values between the V0.15 and Vmin schemes and the variance of target genes expression levels generated by these two schemes showed that different schemes do indeed have a significant effect on the eventual normalization of target genes. Three selection schemes were adopted in terms of the adipose tissue, including the three optimal reference genes (Opt3), V0.20 and Vmin schemes, and the analysis of NF values with eventual normalization of target genes showed that the different selection schemes also have a significant effect on the eventual normalization of target genes.
              
                Conclusions
                Based on these results, the proposed cut-off value of Vn/n + 1 under 0.15, according to the geNorm algorithm, should be considered with caution. For cell only experiments, at least rBMSCs, a Vn/n + 1 under 0.15 is sufficient in RT-qPCR studies. However, when using certain tissue types such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue the minimum Vn/n + 1 should be used instead as this provides a far superior mode of generating accurate gene expression results. We thus recommended that when the stability and variation of a candidate reference genes in a specific study is unclear the minimum Vn/n + 1 should always be used as this ensures the best and most accurate gene expression value is achieved during RT-qPCR assays.

Functional analysis of genes involved in the synthesis, accumulation, and degradation of bioactive compounds in these medicinal plants requires accurate measurement of their expression profiles. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is a primary tool, which requires stably expressed reference genes to serve as the internal references to normalize the target gene expression. In this study, the stability of 14 candidate reference genes from the two congeneric species G. uralensis and G. inflata, including ACT, CAC, CYP, DNAJ, DREB, EF1, RAN, TIF1, TUB, UBC2, ABCC2, COPS3, CS, R3HDM2, were evaluated across different tissues and throughout various developmental stages. More importantly, we investigated the impact of interactions between tissue and developmental stage on the performance of candidate reference genes. Four algorithms, including geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and Delta Ct, were used to analyze the expression stability and RefFinder, a comprehensive software, provided the final recommendation. Based on previous research and our preliminary data, we hypothesized that internal references for spatio-temporal gene expression are different from the reference genes suited for individual factors. In G. uralensis, the top three most stable reference genes across different tissues were R3HDM2, CAC and TUB, while CAC, CYP and ABCC2 were most suited for different developmental stages. CAC is the only candidate recommended for both biotic factors, which is reflected in the stability ranking for the spatio (tissue)-temporal (developmental stage) interactions (CAC, R3HDM2 and DNAJ). Similarly, in G. inflata, COPS3, R3HDM2 and DREB were selected for tissues, while RAN, COPS3 and CS were recommended for developmental stages. For the tissue-developmental stage interactions, COPS3, DREB and ABCC2 were the most suited reference genes. In both species, only one of the top three candidates was shared between the individual factors and their interactions, specifically, CAC in G. uralensis and COPS3 in G. inflata, which supports our overarching hypothesis. In summary, spatio-temporal selection of reference genes not only lays the foundation for functional genomics research in Glycyrrhiza, but also facilitates these traditional medicinal herbs to reach/maximize their pharmaceutical potential.",Scientific Reports,2021

The UBQ1/TUB reference genes combination was able to reveal small significant differences in gene expression of the two target genes that were not detectable when using the least stable reference gene combination. These results can be used to inform the choice of reference genes to use in the study of the sugarcane floral induction pathway. Our work also demonstrates that both PIL5 and LHP1 are significantly up-regulated in the initial stages of photoperiodic induction of flowering in sugarcane.",Scientific Reports,2021

In this study, 12 reference genes were selected on the basis of transcriptomic data. These genes were used to determine the most stably expressed genes in various organs of Caucasian clover under cold, salt and drought stress for qRT-PCR-based analysis. Reference gene stability was analyzed by geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, the ∆Ct method and RefFinder. Under salt stress, RCD1 and PPIL3 were the most stable reference genes in the leaves, and NLI1 and RCD1 were the most stable references genes in the roots. Under low-temperature stress, APA and EFTu-GTP were the most stable reference genes in the leaves, and the RCD1 and NLI2 genes were highly stable in the roots. Under 10% PEG-6000 stress, NLI1 and NLI2 were highly stable in the leaves, and RCD1 and PPIL3 were the most stable in the roots. Overall, RCD1 and NLI2 were the most stable reference genes in organs under normal conditions and across all samples.

                Background
                Gene transcripts that show invariant abundance during development are ideal as reference genes (RGs) for accurate gene expression analyses, such as RNA blot analysis and reverse transcription–quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses. In a genome-wide analysis, we selected three “Commonly used” housekeeping genes (HKGs), fifteen “Traditional” HKGs, and nine novel genes as candidate RGs based on 80 publicly available transcriptome libraries that include data for receptacle development in eight strawberry cultivars.
              
                Results
                The results of the multifaceted assessment consistently revealed that expression of the novel RGs showed greater stability compared with that of the “Commonly used” and “Traditional” HKGs in transcriptome and RT-qPCR analyses. Notably, the majority of stably expressed genes were associated with the ubiquitin proteasome system. Among these, two 26 s proteasome subunits, RPT6A and RPN5A, showed superior expression stability and abundance, and are recommended as the optimal RGs combination for normalization of gene expression during strawberry receptacle development.
              
                Conclusion
                These findings provide additional useful and reliable RGs as resources for the accurate study of gene expression during receptacle development in strawberry cultivars.

Numerous studies focused on the chemistry, bioactivities, toxicology, and clinical trials of HupA; however, the public genomic and transcriptomic resources are very limited for H. serrata research, especially for the selection of optimum reference genes. Based on the full‐length transcriptome datasets and previous studies, 10 traditional and three new candidate reference genes were selected in different tissue of H. serrata. Then, two optimal reference genes GAPDHB and HisH2A were confirmed by four analysis methods. In order to further verify the accuracy of the two reference genes, they were used to analyze the expression patterns of four HupA‐biosynthetic genes (lysine decarboxylas, RS‐norcoclaurine 6‐O‐methyltransferase, cytochrome P45072A1, and copper amine oxidase). The data suggested that the expression pattern of HupA‐biosynthetic genes was consistent with them in transcriptome sequencing in different tissue of H. serrata.

Utilization of the reference genes without analyzing their expression stability under each experimental condition causes RT-qPCR analysis error as well as false output. Similar to cancerous tissues, cancer cell lines also exhibit various gene expression profiles. It is crucial to recognize stable reference genes for well-known cancer cell lines to minimize RT-qPCR analysis error. In this study, we showed the expression level and investigated the expression stability of eight common reference genes that are ACTB, YWHAZ, HPRT1, RNA18S, TBP, GAPDH, UBC, and B2M, in two sets of cancerous cell lines. One set contains MCF7, SKBR3, and MDA-MB231 as breast cancer cell lines. Another set includes three hepatic cancer cell lines, including Huh7, HepG2, and PLC-PRF5. Three excel-based softwares comprising geNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder, and an online tool, namely RefFinder were used for stability analysis. Although all four algorithms did not show the same stability ranking of nominee genes, the overall results showed B2M and ACTB as the least stable reference genes for the studied breast cancer cell lines. While TBP had the lowest expression stability in the three hepatic cancer cell lines. Moreover, YWHAZ, UBC, and GAPDH showed the highest stability in breast cancer cell lines. Besides that, a panel of five nominees, including ACTB, HPRT1, UBC, YWHAZ, and B2M showed higher stability than others in hepatic cancer cell lines. We believe that our results would help researchers to find and to select the best combination of the reference genes for their own experiments involving the studied breast and hepatic cancer cell lines. To further analyze the reference genes stability for each experimental condition, we suggest researchers to consider the provided stability ranking emphasizing the unstable reference genes.",PLOS ONE,2021

Accurate characterization of the gene expression profiles of genes of interest is essential to the exploration of the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms of rumen development in goats. Thus, the selection of suitable reference genes (RGs) is an important prerequisite for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). In the present study, 16 candidate RGs were identified from our previous transcriptome sequencing of caprine rumen tissues. The quantitative expressions of the candidate RGs were measured using the RT-qPCR method, and the expression stability of the RGs was assessed using the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper programs. GeNorm analysis showed that the M values were less than 0.5 for all the RGs except GAPT4, indicating that they were stably expressed in the rumen tissues throughout development. RPS4X and RPS6 were the two most stable RGs. Furthermore, the expressions of two randomly selected target genes (IGF1 and TOP2A), normalized by the selected most stable RGs (RPS4X and RPS6), were consistent with the results of RNA sequencing, while the use of GAPDH and ACTB as RGs resulted in altered profiles. Overall, RPS4X and RPS6 showed the highest expression stability and the lowest coefficients of variation, and could be used as the optimal reference combination for quantifying gene expression in rumen tissues via RT-qPCR analysis.",Animals,2021

The latter may serve as a resource of potential reference genes for normalization of target gene expression determined using quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR). We selected 11 candidate reference genes from our RNA‐seq analysis of red pitaya fruit ripening (ACT7, EF‐1α, IF‐4α, PTBP, PP2A, EF2, Hsp70, GAPDH, DNAJ, TUB and CYP), as well as β‐ACT, which has been used as a reference gene for pitayas in previous studies. We then comprehensively evaluated their expression stability during fruit ripening using four statistical methods (GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and DeltaCt) and merged the four outputs using the online tool RefFinder for the final ranking. We report that PTBP and DNAJ showed the most stable expression patterns, whereas CYP and ACT7 showed the least stable expression patterns. The relative gene expression of red pitaya sucrose synthase and 4, 5‐dihydroxyphenylalanine‐extradiol‐dioxygenase as determined by quantitative real‐time PCR and normalized to PTBP and DNAJ was consistent with the RNA‐seq results, suggesting that PTBP and DNAJ are suitable reference genes for studies of red pitaya fruit ripening.",FEBS Open Bio,2021

A better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying its adaptation to toxic host compounds may unleash the potential for future management of this pest. Gene expression studies could be considered as one of the key experimental approaches for such purposes. A suitable reference gene selection is fundamental for quantitative gene expression analysis and functional genomics studies in I. sexdentatus. Twelve commonly used reference genes in Coleopterans were screened under different experimental conditions to obtain accurate and reliable normalization of gene expression data. The majority of the 12 reference genes showed a relatively stable expression pattern among developmental stages, tissue-specific, and sex-specific stages; however, some variabilities were observed during varied temperature incubation. Under developmental conditions, the Tubulin beta-1 chain (β-Tubulin) was the most stable reference gene, followed by translation elongation factor (eEF2) and ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3). In sex-specific conditions, RPS3, β-Tubulin, and eEF2 were the most stable reference genes. In contrast, different sets of genes were shown higher stability in terms of expression under tissue-specific conditions, i.e., RPS3 and eEF2 in head tissue, V-ATPase-A and eEF2 in the fat body, V-ATPase-A and eEF2 in the gut. Under varied temperatures, β-Tubulin and V-ATPase-A were most stable, whereas ubiquitin (UbiQ) and V-ATPase-A displayed the highest expression stability after Juvenile Hormone III treatment. The findings were validated further using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR)-based target gene expression analysis.

In this work, we used five common statistics tools (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCt method, RefFinder) to evaluate 10 candidate reference genes. The results showed that Unigene.16454 and Unigene.16459 were the optimal reference genes for different tissues, Unigene.16454 and zinc finger ran-binding domain-containing protein 2 (ZRANB2) for chimeric leaf at different developmental stages, isocitrate dehydrogenase [NADP] (IDH) and triacylglycerol lipase SDP1-like (SDP) for seedlings under different hormone treatments.

This work aimed to evaluate the stability of reference gene expression in Ae. tauschii under different abiotic stresses (salinity, drought, hot, and cold) and developmental stages (seedling and development). The results show that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 36-like (UBC36) and protein microrchidia 2-like (HSP) are the most stable genes under control and salinity conditions, respectively.

We have developed an improved reference gene for the sensitive detection of CLas from plants in diagnostic duplex qPCR and analytical digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) assays. The mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene (COX), widely used as a reference, is not ideal because its high copy number can inhibit amplification of small quantities of target genes. In ddPCRs, oversaturation of droplets complicates data normalization and quantification. The variable copy numbers of COX gene in metabolically active young tissue, greenhouse plants, and citrus relatives suggest the need for a non-variable, nuclear, low copy, universal reference gene for analysis of HLB hosts. The single-copy nuclear gene, malate dehydrogenase (MDH), developed here as a reference gene, is amenable to data normalization, suitable for duplex qPCR and ddPCR assays. The sequence of MDH fragment selected is conserved in most HLB hosts in the taxonomic group Aurantioideae.

At present, there is no experiment to systematically analyse the stability of internal reference gene (RG) expression in RCM. In this experiment, leaves that did not form gallnuts were used as the control group, while leaves that formed gallnuts were used as the experimental group. First, we conducted transcriptome experiments on RCM leaves to obtain 45 103 differential genes and functional enrichment annotations between the two groups. On this basis, this experiment established a transcriptional gene change model of leaves in the process of gallnut formation after being bitten by aphids, and RCM reference candidate genes were screened from RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) data. This study is based on RCM transcriptome data and evaluates the stability of 11 potential reference genes under cold stress (4 °C) and heat stress (34 °C), using three statistical algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper). The results show that GAPDH1 + PP2A2/UBQ are stable reference genes under heat stress, while GAPDH1 + ACT are the most stable under cold stress.

               Stably expressed reference genes are critical internal standards for the quantification of gene transcription levels using quantitative real-time PCR. Housekeeping genes are commonly used as reference genes but their expressions were variable depending on experimental conditions in many insect species studied. Here we report the identification and evaluation of 10 housekeeping genes in alligator weed flea beetle, Agasicles hygrophila Selman &amp; Vogt (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), a biocontrol agent of alligator weed. The 10 housekeeping genes are: beta-actin (Actin), ribosomal protein L13A (PRL13a), succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA), ribosomal protein S20 (RPS20), ribosomal protein S13 (RPS13), glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), TATA-box-binding protein (TBP), ribosomal protein L32 (RPL32), tubulin alpha-1 chain (TUBULIN), and elongation factor-1 alpha (ELF). Five programs, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCt method, and RefFinder, were used to evaluate the expression stability of the 10 genes among various A. hygrophila body parts and with different nutrient types (starvation, diet types). The expression stability analysis showed that RPS32 and RPL13a were reliable reference genes for the study of gene transcription in different body parts; Actin and RPL13a were optimal reference genes for different nutrient types. The selections of reference genes were validated using a CarE gene (GeneBank No: KX353552). The results of this study provide useful bases for studies of gene expression in various aspects relating to A. hygrophila.",Journal of Insect Science,2021

Malignant cells from the tumor undergo metabolic alterations to obtain the energy required for proliferation and the invasion of the cerebral parenchyma. The alterations in the expression of the genes related to the metabolic pathways can be detected in biopsies of gliomas of different CNS WHO grades. In this study, we evaluated the expression of 16 candidate reference genes in the HMC3 microglia cell line. Then, statistical algorithms such as BestKeeper, the comparative ΔCT method, geNorm, NormFinder, and RefFinder were applied to obtain the genes most suitable to be considered as references for measuring the levels of expression in glioma samples. The results show that PKM and TPI1 are two novel genes suitable for genic expression studies on gliomas. Finally, we analyzed the expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways in clinical samples of brain gliomas of different CNS WHO grades. RT-qPCR analysis showed that in CNS WHO grade 3 and 4 gliomas, the expression levels of HK1, PFKM, GAPDH, G6PD, PGD1, IDH1, FASN, ACACA, and ELOVL2 were higher than those of CNS WHO grade 1 and 2 glioma biopsies. Hence, our results suggest that reference genes from metabolic pathways have different expression profiles depending on the stratification of gliomas and constitute a potential model for studying the development of this type of tumor and the search for molecular targets to treat gliomas.",Genes,2021

Studies of relative gene expression require the identification of the most stable reference genes for the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to investigate the reproductive tissues' response in laying hens kept in different production systems. The objective of this study was to determine the most stable reference genes of the magnum tissues of laying hens housed in two different production systems. Hy‐Line Brown hens were reared under the same sanitary conditions until 15 weeks of age. Later on, they were transferred into two different production systems, conventional cage (CC) and cage free (CF), up to 82 weeks of age. At 50 and 60 weeks, a total of six hens from each production system were euthanized, and magnum samples were collected. The qPCR was used to determine the RNA transcription level of five reference genes, ACTB, 18S, GAPDH, MSX2 and HMBS. These genes were evaluated for transcript expression in magnum tissues by NormFinder, BestKeeper, geNorm and RefFinder software. The results indicated that the most stable gene in the CF housing system was HMBS in three of the algorithms and in the CC housing system was the 18S, and the best combination of reference genes was HMBS/GAPDH in CF and 18S/HMBS in CC. In conclusion, HMBS, 18S and GAPDH genes could be used together as reference genes for the normalization of the magnum tissues transcript expression of hens in CF and CC housing systems.",Veterinary Medicine and Science,2021

Quantifying the expression levels of functional genes by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is necessary to elucidate the response mechanisms of A. acidoterrestris to acid stress. However, appropriate reference genes (RGs) for data normalization are required to obtain reliable RT-qPCR results. In this study, eight novel candidate RGs were screened based on transcriptome datasets of A. acidoterrestris under acid stress. The expression stability of eight new RGs and commonly used RG 16s rRNA was assessed using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms. Moreover, the comprehensive analysis using the RefFinder program and the validation using target gene ctsR showed that dnaG and dnaN were the optimal multiple RGs for normalization at pH 4.0; ytvI, dnaG, and 16s rRNA at pH 3.5; icd and dnaG at pH 3.0; and ytvI, dnaG, and spoVE at pH 2.5.

Thus, in this study we evaluated the stability of different reference genes of glyphosate-resistant S. halepense. Nine genes frequently used as reference genes were selected: MDH, ADP, PP2A, EIF4α, ACT, ARI8, DnaJ, Hsp70, and ALS1, and their expression analyzed in susceptible and resistant biotypes at 0, 24 and 72 h post-application of glyphosate. The stability was analyzed with the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software programs and using the ΔCt method. RefFinder was used to generate a comprehensive stability ranking. The results showed that PP2A and ARI8 were the most stable genes under the test conditions. EPSPS expression was also verified against the best two and the worst two reference genes. This study provides useful information for gene expression analysis under glyphosate stress and will facilitate resistance mechanism studies in this weed species.",Plants,2021

A critical, yet often underappreciated, problem when analysing qRT-PCR data is the selection of suitable reference genes. This problem is compounded in situations where up to 25% of all genes may change (e.g., due to leukocyte invasion), as is typically the case in ARDS. Here, we examined 11 widely used reference genes for their suitability in commonly used models of acute lung injury (ALI): ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), in vivo and ex vivo, lipopolysaccharide plus mechanical ventilation (MV), and hydrochloric acid plus MV. The stability of reference gene expression was determined using the NormFinder, BestKeeper, and geNorm algorithms. We then proceeded with the geNorm results because this is the only algorithm that provides the number of reference genes required to achieve normalisation. We chose interleukin-6 (Il-6) and C-X-C motif ligand 1 (Cxcl-1) as the genes of interest to analyse and demonstrate the impact of inappropriate normalisation. Reference gene stability differed between the ALI models and even within the subgroup of VILI models, no common reference gene index (RGI) could be determined. NormFinder, BestKeeper, and geNorm produced slightly different, but comparable results. Inappropriate normalisation of Il-6 and Cxcl1 gene expression resulted in significant misinterpretation in all four ALI settings. In conclusion, choosing an inappropriate normalisation strategy can introduce different kinds of bias such as gain or loss as well as under- or overestimation of effects, affecting the interpretation of gene expression data.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2021

A ranked list of reference genes based on expression stability was assessed using BestKeeper, NormFinder, GeNorm, and ΔCt methods. In Xaj undergoing all tested abiotic stress conditions, two reference genes (RGs) were sufficient for effective normalization of RT‐qPCR data. ATP synthase subunit δ (atpD) and RNA polymerase δ factor (rpoD) were the most stably expressed RGs, while gyrase subunit A (gyrA) and gyrase subunit B (gyrB) were the least stable. A combination of the most and least stable RGs was used for the normalization of two isoforms of three target genes, catalase (cat1 and cat2), superoxide dismutase (sod1 and sod2), and glutathione peroxidase (gpx1 and gpx2), showing that the validation of RGs was needed in each experimental condition to avoid misinterpretation of the expression levels of target genes.

Nevertheless, studies on the mechanistic background are still scarce. Here, the susceptibility of the laboratory SBL-Benzon strain to the Bt proteins Cry1Ac and Cry1F was determined in diet overlay assays and revealed a greater activity of Cry1Ac than Cry1F, thus confirming results obtained for other sensitive SBL strains.

Background
Real-time PCR remains currently the gold standard method for gene expression studies. Identification of the best reference gene is a key point in performing high-quality qPCR, providing strong support for results, and performing as a source of bias when inappropriately chosen. Mesangial cells and podocytes, as essential cell lines to study diabetic kidney disease (DKD) physiopathology, demand accurate analysis of the reference genes used thus far to enhance the validity of gene expression studies, especially regarding high glucose (HG) and DKD treatments, with angiotensin II receptor blockers (e.g., losartan) being the most commonly used. This study aimed to evaluate the suitability and define the most stable reference gene for mesangial cell and podocyte studies of an in vitro DKD model of disease and its treatment.


Methods
Five software packages (RefFinder, NormFinder, GeNorm, Bestkeeper, and DataAssist) and the comparative ΔCt method were selected to analyze six different candidate genes: HPRT, ACTB, PGAM-1, GAPDH, PPIA, and B2M. RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized from immortalized mouse mesangial cells and podocytes cultured in 4 groups: control (n = 5; 5 mM glucose), mannitol (n = 5; 30 mM, as osmotic control), HG (n = 5; 30 mM glucose), and HG + losartan (n = 5; 30 mM glucose and 10−4 mM losartan). Real-time PCR was performed according to MIQE guidelines.


Results
We identified that the use of 2 genes was the best combination for qPCR normalization for both mesangial cells and podocytes. For mesangial cells, the combination of HPRT and ACTB presented higher stability values. For podocytes, HPRT and GAPDH showed the best results.


Conclusion
This analysis provides support for the use of HPRT and ACTB as reference genes in mouse mesangial cell studies of gene expression via real-time PCR, while for podocytes, HPRT and GAPDH should be chosen.

However, no detailed study has been conducted on reference genes in different tissues of oat under diverse abiotic stress conditions. In our work, nine candidate reference genes (ACT, TUB, CYP, GAPD, UBC, EF1, TBP, ADPR, PGD) were chosen and analysed by four statistical methods (GeNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, RefFinder). Samples were taken from two tissues (leaves and roots) of 13-day-old oat plants exposed to five abiotic stresses (drought, salt, heavy metal, low and high temperatures). ADPR was the top-rated reference gene for all samples, while different genes proved to be the most stable depending on tissue type and treatment combinations.

This parasite is usually found as a motile flagellated trophozoite. However, when subjected to stressful microenvironmental conditions,T. vaginalistrophozoites can differentiate into peculiar cyst-like stages, which exhibit notable physiological resistance to unfavourable conditions. Although well documented in morphological and proteomic terms, patterns of gene expression changes involved in the cellular differentiation into cyst-like stages are mostly unknown. The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is recognized as a sensitive and accurate method for quantification of gene expression, providing fluorescence-based data that are proportional to the amount of a target RNA. However, the reliability of relative expression studies depends on the validation of suitable reference genes, which RNAs exhibit a minimum of variation between tested conditions. Here, we attempt to determine suitable reference genes to be used as controls of invariant expression during cold-inducedin vitrodifferentiation ofT. vaginalistrophozoites into cyst-like forms. Furthermore, we reveal that the mRNA from the meiotic recombinase Dmc1 is upregulated during this process, indicating that cryptic sexual events may take place in cyst-like stages ofT. vaginalis.",Parasitology,2021

Species within this genus are clinically, agriculturally and biotechnologically relevant, leading to increasing interest in elucidating gene expression dynamics of key metabolic and physiological processes. Reverse-transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) is a sensitive and specific method of quantifying gene expression. A crucial step for comparing RT-qPCR results between strains and experimental conditions is normalisation to experimentally validated reference gene(s). In this review, we provide a critical analysis of current reference gene selection and validation practices for RT-qPCR gene expression analyses of Aspergillus. Of 90 primary research articles obtained through our PubMed query, 17 experimentally validated the reference gene(s) used. Twenty reference genes were used across the 90 studies, with beta-tubulin being the most used reference gene, followed by actin, 18S rRNA and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Sixteen of the 90 studies used multiple reference genes for normalisation.

Warburton","Resistance against infection by the fungus Aspergillus flavus Link in commercial maize (Zea mays L.) is the topic of many studies, but few studies have investigated the effects of A. flavus infection on gene expression levels in ear kernels. A crucial component of gene expression profiling by RT-qPCR is having a reliable set of reference genes that show relatively constant expression across the treatments and phenotypes under study. Currently, however, there is no published information on reference genes suitable for measuring changes in kernel gene expression levels after infection with A. flavus. Thus, in this study, six candidate reference genes (ACT1, β-Tub2, eIF4A2, TATA, EFIα, and GAPDH) were evaluated and ranked according to their expression stability. The genes were amplified from first-strand cDNA samples synthesized from kernels of two susceptible and two resistant maize lines that were either inoculated with A. flavus or water or not inoculated. Three software packages were used to calculate and rank the stability of expression for these genesgeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The analysis revealed that the most stable genes to normalize expression levels from maize kernels responding to A. flavus inoculation and wounding were ACT1, EFIα, and eIF4A2.",Toxins,2021

The RNA content of small extracellular vesicles including exosomes is growingly considered as cancer biomarkers. So, reliable relative quantification of exosomal messenger RNA (mRNA) is essential for cancer diagnosis and prognosis applications. However, suitable reference genes for accurate normalization of a target gene in exosomes derived from cancer cells are not depicted yet. Here, we analyzed the expression and stability of eight well‐known reference genes namely GAPDH, B2M, HPRT1, ACTB, YWHAZ, UBC, RNA18S, and TBP in exosomes‐isolated from the liver (Huh7, HepG2, PLC/PRF/5) and breast (SK‐BR‐3) cancer cell lines using five different algorithms including geNorm, BestKeeper, Delta Ct, NormFinder, and RefFinder. Our results showed that ACTB, TBP, and HPRT1 were not expressed in exosomes‐isolated from studied liver and breast cancer cell lines. The geNorm and BestKeeper algorithms indicated GAPDH and UBC as the most stable candidates. Moreover, Delta Ct and NormFinder algorithms showed YWHAZ as the most stable reference genes. Comprehensive ranking calculated by the RefFinder algorithm also pointed out GAPDH, YWHAZ, and UBC as the first three stable reference genes. Taken together, this study validated the common reference genes stability in exosomal mRNA derived from liver and breast cancer cell lines for the first time. We believe that this study would be the first step in finding more stable reference genes in exosomes that triggers more accurate detection of exosomal biomarkers.",Cell Biology International,2021

Curtis","AbstractIn situ hybridization (ISH) is a powerful tool that can be used to localize mRNA expression in tissue samples. Combining ISH with immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine cell type provides cellular context of mRNA expression, which cannot be achieved with gene microarray or polymerase chain reaction. To study mRNA and protein expression on the same section we investigated the use of RNAscope® ISH in combination with fluorescent IHC on paraffin‐embedded human brain tissue. We first developed a high‐throughput, automated image analysis workflow for quantifying RNA puncta across the total cell population and within neurons identified by NeuN+ immunoreactivity. We then applied this automated analysis to tissue microarray (TMA) sections of middle temporal gyrus tissue (MTG) from neurologically normal and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cases to determine the suitability of three commonly used housekeeping genes: ubiquitin C (UBC), peptidyl‐prolyl cis‐trans isomerase B (PPIB) and DNA‐directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1 (POLR2A). Overall, we saw a significant decrease in total and neuronal UBC expression in AD cases compared to normal cases. Total expression results were validated with RT‐qPCR using fresh frozen tissue from 5 normal and 5 AD cases. We conclude that this technique combined with our novel automated analysis pipeline provides a suitable platform to study changes in gene expression in diseased human brain tissue with cellular and anatomical context. Furthermore, our results suggest that UBC is not a suitable housekeeping gene in the study of post‐mortem AD brain tissue.

The identification of evenly expressed reference genes is necessary for accurate quantitative gene expression analysis, whether by traditional RT-PCR (reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) or by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time PCR; qPCR). In the Stramenopiles (the major line of eukaryotes that includes brown algae) there is a noted lack of known reference genes for such studies, largely due to the absence of available molecular tools. Here we present a set of nine reference genes (Elongation Factor 1 alpha (EF1A), Elongation Factor 2 alpha (EF2A), Elongation Factor 1 beta (EF1B), 14-3-3 Protein, Ubiquitin Conjugating Enzyme (UBCE2), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Actin Related Protein Complex (ARP2/3), Ribosomal Protein (40s; S23), and Actin) for the brown alga Fucus distichus. These reference genes were tested on adult sporophytes across six abiotic stress conditions (desiccation, light and temperature modification, hormone addition, pollutant exposure, nutrient addition, and wounding). Suitability of these genes as reference genes was quantitatively evaluated across conditions using standard methods and the majority of the tested genes were evaluated favorably. However, we show that normalization genes should be chosen on a condition-by-condition basis. We provide a recommendation that at least two reference genes be used per experiment, a list of recommended pairs for the conditions tested here, and a procedure for identifying a suitable set for an experimenter’s unique design. With the recent expansion of interest in brown algal biology and accompanied molecular tools development, the variety of experimental conditions tested here makes this study a valuable resource for future work in basic biology and understanding stress responses in the brown algal lineage.",PLOS ONE,2021

A new drug with a good curative effect on RA has recently been developed from the extract of A. flaccida rhizomes, of which the main medicinal ingredients are triterpenoid saponins. Due to excessive exploitation, the wild population has been scarce and endangered in a few of its natural habitats and research on the cultivation of the plant commenced. Studies on the gene expressions related to the biosynthesis of triterpenoid saponins are not only helpful for understanding the effects of environmental factors on the medicinal ingredient accumulations but also necessary for monitoring the herb quality of the cultivated plants. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) as a sensitive and powerful technique has been widely used to detect gene expression across tissues in plants at different stages; however, its accuracy and reliability depend largely on the reference gene selection. In this study, the expressions of 10 candidate reference genes were evaluated in various organs of the wild and cultivated plants at different stages, using the algorithms of geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, respectively. The purpose of this study was to identify the suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR detection in A. flaccida. The results showed that two reference genes were sufficient for RT-qPCR data normalization in A. flaccida.

In marine intertidal environment, S. latissima has to cope with both biotic and abiotic stress, which can cause the reduction of the yield during cultivation. To better understand the physiological responses of S. latissima under different stress conditions, large-scale transcriptomic analyses are useful to explore global metabolic pathway regulations. In addition, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a powerful and rapid method for further quantifying changes in gene expression, and for targeting specific defense-related gene pathways. However, its level of accuracy is highly related to the expression stability of reference genes used for normalization and those still need to be evaluated in S. latissima. In this study, we therefore experimentally tested eight candidate reference genes identified from in silico screening of public transcriptomic datasets of S. latissima from different abiotic and biotic stress treatments. The stability analysis using complementary statistical approaches showed that EIF5B and ATPase are the most stable reference genes under biotic stress, whereas, under temperature and light stress, their combination with NDH gene is the best choice for RT-qPCR normalization.

               Housekeeping (HK) genes are constitutively expressed genes that are required for the maintenance of basic cellular functions. Despite their importance in the calibration of gene expression, as well as the understanding of many genomic and evolutionary features, important discrepancies have been observed in studies that previously identified these genes. Here, we present Housekeeping and Reference Transcript Atlas (HRT Atlas v1.0, www.housekeeping.unicamp.br) a web-based database which addresses some of the previously observed limitations in the identification of these genes, and offers a more accurate database of human and mouse HK genes and transcripts. The database was generated by mining massive human and mouse RNA-seq data sets, including 11 281 and 507 high-quality RNA-seq samples from 52 human non-disease tissues/cells and 14 healthy tissues/cells of C57BL/6 wild type mouse, respectively. User can visualize the expression and download lists of 2158 human HK transcripts from 2176 HK genes and 3024 mouse HK transcripts from 3277 mouse HK genes. HRT Atlas also offers the most stable and suitable tissue selective candidate reference transcripts for normalization of qPCR experiments. Specific primers and predicted modifiers of gene expression for some of these HK transcripts are also proposed.

10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16972.1,Identification of qPCR reference genes suitable for normalising gene expression in the developing mouse embryo,"John C.W. Hildyard, Dominic J. Wells, Richard J. Piercy","Background: Progression through mammalian embryogenesis involves many interacting cell types and multiple differentiating cell lineages. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of gene expression in the developing embryo is a valuable tool for deciphering these processes, but normalisation to stably-expressed reference genes is essential for such analyses. Gene expression patterns change globally and dramatically as embryonic development proceeds, rendering identification of consistently appropriate reference genes challenging. Methods: We have investigated expression stability in mouse embryos from mid to late gestation (E11.5–E18.5), both at the whole-embryo level, and within the head and forelimb specifically, using 15 candidate reference genes (ACTB, 18S, SDHA, GAPDH, HTATSF1, CDC40, RPL13A, CSNK2A2, AP3D1, HPRT1, CYC1, EIF4A, UBC, B2M and PAK1IP1), and four complementary algorithms (geNorm, Normfinder, Bestkeeper and deltaCt). Results: Unexpectedly, all methods suggest that many genes within our candidate panel are acceptable references, though AP3D1, RPL13A and PAK1IP1 are the strongest performing genes overall.

We collected blood samples from healthy female dogs and females with canine mammary cancer in Manizales, Colombia between June 2018 and January 2019, and mRNA was isolated from each sample for cDNA synthesis. qRT-PCR-based expression assays were performed using primers designed for gamma-actin, beta-actin, GAPDH, and 18S genes. We calculated the amplification efficiency, specificity, and stability using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the ΔCt comparative method. We obtained linear regressions to verify constant gene expression and conducted an ANOVA to detect expression differences regarding Ct values and healthy vs. ill conditions. We found stability for primers 18S-1, GAPDH-1, GAPDH-NM, and Gamma-actin-1 (in increasing order). Furthermore, these genes showed constant expression levels in patients (R2&amp;gt;0.80).

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is the most accurate and widely used gene expression evaluation technique, and selecting appropriate reference genes (RGs) is essential for normalizing qRT-PCR results. However, suitable RGs for gene expression normalization in C. fortunei have not been reported. Here, we tested the expression stability for 12 RGs in C. fortunei under various experimental conditions (simulated abiotic stresses (cold, heat, drought, and salinity) and hormone treatments (methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and gibberellin) and in different tissues (stems, tender needles, needles, cones, and seeds) using four algorithms (delta Ct, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper). Then, geometric mean rankings from these algorithms and the RefFinder program were used to comprehensively evaluate RG stability. The results indicated CYP, actin, UBC, and 18S as good choices for studying C. fortunei gene expression. qRT-PCR analysis of the expression patterns of three target genes (CAT and MAPK1/6) further verified that the selected RGs were suitable for gene expression normalization.

The accurate choice of reference genes is required for normalization of gene expression in qRT‐PCR analysis. In order to identify the optimal candidates for gene expression analysis using qRT‐PCR in Agaricus blazei, we studied the potential reference genes in this economically important edible fungus. In this study, transcriptome datasets were used as source for identification of candidate reference genes. And 27 potential reference genes including 21 newly stable genes, three classical housekeeping genes, and homologous genes of three ideal reference genes in Volvariella volvacea, were screened based on transcriptome datasets of A. blazei and previous studies. The expression stability of these genes was investigated by qRT‐PCR analysis and further evaluated by four software packages, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. Among these candidates, α‐TUB (Tubulin alpha) and Cox5a (COX5A subunit VA of cytochrome c oxidase) were revealed as the most stable in fruit body, and suitable for 5 different developmental stages. α‐TUB and ATP3 (ATP3 gamma subunit of the F1 sector of mitochondrial F1F0 ATP synthase) showed the most stable expression in stipe tissues and, Uqcrc (core subunit of the ubiquinol‐cytochrome c reductase complex) and PUP3 (20S proteasome subunit beta 3) performed well in pileus tissues during the process of A. blazei development, while GAPDH (glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase) was among the least stable genes in all sample sets. Finally, the Ableln3 (homology of eln3 gene of Coprinus cinereus) was adopted to validate the reliability of these stable and unstable reference genes, indicating that the use of unsuitable reference genes as internal controls could change the target gene’s expression pattern.

Reihb.f., a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has attracted increasing attention because of its wide range of applicability to the medical field and chemical industry. B. striata has been identified to be particularly sensitive to high temperatures. Thus, the study of temperature stress on gene transcription is of interest in the field. Use of reliable reference genes is essential for qRT-PCR analysis of genes. However, little information regarding suitable reference genes for the genus Bletilla has been published. In this study, the sequences of seven potential reference genes in B. striata were obtained via a homology cloning strategy. These genes were as follows: glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 18S ribosomal RNA (18S), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α), α-tubulin (TUA), β-tubulin (TUB), ubiquitin (UBI), and NAC domain protein (NAC). We then evaluated the stability levels of these transcripts in different tissues (root, tuber, and leaf) exposed to high temperature using three conventional software and comprehensive RefFinder algorithms. The results indicated that 18S and TUB were the best internal control genes among different periods of heat treatment and that a combination of 18S and UBI was the best in different tissues. Altogether, 18S and UBI were identified to be the best reference genes for all the samples, while NAC and TUA were the least stable reference genes.

               Chrysoperla nipponensis (Okamoto), which has the unique diapause phenotype distinguishable from nondiapause adult, is an ideal model organism for studying the mechanism of reproductive diapause. However, there is no reliable and effective reference genes used for the reproductive diapause study of C. nipponensis. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the expression stability of 10 candidate reference genes (Tub1, Arpc5, EF1a, 128up, RpS5, RpS26e, GAPDH, Arp3, Actin, α-Tub) in adults under diapause and nondiapause induction conditions using four statistical algorithms including GeNorm, NormFinder, Bestkeeper, and ∆CT method. Results showed that Arp3 and Tub1 were the most stable reference genes in all samples and in the adult tissues group. Arp3 and RpS5 were the most stable reference genes in the development degree group. α-Tub and EF1a were unstable reference genes under the conditions of this study. Meanwhile, to verify the reliability of the reference genes, we evaluated the relative expression levels of Vg and VgR in different treatments. Significant upregulation and downregulation in expression level of two genes in response to diapause termination and diapause fat body tissue was, respectively, observed when using Arp3 as the reference gene but not when using an unstable reference gene. The reference genes identified in this work provided not only the basis for future functional genomics research in diapause of C. nipponensis and will also identify reliable normalization factors for real-time quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction data for other related insects.",Journal of Insect Science,2020

Taxol or paclitaxel is an important anticancer compound mainly identified in Taxus spp. The molecular mechanism of the regulation of taxol biosynthesis is current research goal. However, in the case of Taxus spp., few reports were published on screening suitable reference genes as internal controls for qRT-PCR. Here, eight reference genes were selected as candidate reference genes for further study. Common statistical algorithms geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCt, and RefFinder were used to analyze the data from samples collected from a cell line of Taxus × media under various experimental conditions and from tissues of Taxus chinensis var. mairei. The expression patterns of TcMYC under salicylic acid treatment differed significantly, with the best and worst reference genes in the cell line. This study screened out suitable reference genes (GAPDH1 and SAND) under different treatments and tissues for the accurate and reliable normalization of the qRT-PCR expression data of Taxus spp. At the same time, this study will aid future research on taxol biosynthesis-related genes expression in Taxus spp., and can also be directly used to other related species.",Scientific Reports,2020

With the advent of the Genomics Era, there is an unprecedented opportunity to address the evolution of eusociality and the acquisition of lignocellulases at the genetic level. However, to quantify gene expression, an appropriate normalization strategy is warranted to control for the non-specific variations among samples across different experimental conditions. To search for the internal references, 10 housekeeping genes from a gut transcriptome of a wood-feeding cockroach, Cryptocercus punctulatus, were selected as the candidates for the RT-qPCR analysis. The expression profiles of these candidates, including ACT, EF1α, GAPDH, HSP60, HSP70, αTUB, UBC, RPS18, ATPase and GST, were analyzed using a panel of analytical tools, including geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and comparative ΔCT method. RefFinder, a comprehensive ranking system integrating all four above-mentioned algorithms, rated ACT as the most stable reference gene for different developmental stages and tissues. Expression analysis of the target genes, Hex-1 and Cell-1, using the most or the least appropriate reference genes and a single or multiple normalizers signified this research.

Watanabe","AbstractStudies on induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells highly rely on the investigation of their gene expression which requires normalization by housekeeping genes. Whether the housekeeping genes are stable during the iPS reprogramming, a transition of cell state known to be associated with profound changes, has been overlooked. In this study we analyzed the expression patterns of the most comprehensive list to date of housekeeping genes during iPS reprogramming of a mouse neural stem cell line N31. Our results show that housekeeping genes’ expression fluctuates significantly during the iPS reprogramming. Clustering analysis shows that ribosomal genes’ expression is rising, while the expression of cell-specific genes, such as vimentin (Vim) or elastin (Eln), is decreasing. To ensure the robustness of the obtained data, we performed a correlative analysis of the genes. Overall, all 70 genes analyzed changed the expression more than two-fold during the reprogramming. The scale of this analysis, that takes into account 70 previously known and newly suggested genes, allowed us to choose the most stable of all genes. We highlight the fact of fluctuation of housekeeping genes during iPS reprogramming, and propose that, to ensure robustness of qPCR experiments in iPS cells, housekeeping genes should be used together in combination, and with a prior testing in a specific line used in each study. We suggest that the longest splice variants of Rpl13a, Rplp1 and Rps18 can be used as a starting point for such initial testing as the most stable candidates.",Scientific Reports,2020

RT-qPCR is a fundamental approach in numerous research fields, including biomaterials, yet little attention has been given to the potential impact of 3D versus monolayer (2D) cell culture and to the requirement for a constant validation of the multiple steps of gene expression analysis. The aim of this study is to use high-quality RNA to identify the most suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis during the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BM-MSCs). BM-MSCs are cultured under osteogenic conditions for 28 days in 2D or within hyaluronic acid hydrogels (3D). RNA is subject to quality controls and is then used to identify the most stable reference genes using geNorm, NormFinder, and the ∆Cq method. The effect of the reverse transcriptase is investigated, as well as the expression of osteogenic-related markers. This study shows marked differences in the stability of reference genes between 2D (RPLP0/GAPDH) and 3D (OAZ1/PPIA) culture, suggesting that it is critical to choose appropriate reference genes for 3D osteogenic cell cultures.

                Background
                Real time RT-PCR (qPCR) is a useful and powerful tool for quantitative measurement of gene expression. The proper choice of internal standards such as reference genes is crucial for correct data evaluation. In female dogs, as in other species, the reproductive tract is continuously undergoing hormonal and cycle stage-dependent morphological changes, which are associated with altered gene expression. However, there have been few attempts published so far targeted to the dog aimed at determining optimal reference genes for the reproductive organs. Most of these approaches relied on genes previously described in other species. Large-scale transcriptome-based experiments are promising tools for defining potential candidate reference genes, but were never considered in this context in canine research.
              
                Results
                Here, using available microarray and RNA-seq datasets derived from reproductive organs (corpus luteum, placenta, healthy and diseased uteri) of dogs, we have performed multistudy analysis to identify the most stably expressed genes for expression studies, in each tissue separately and collectively for different tissues. The stability of newly identified reference genes (EIF4H, KDELR2, KDM4A and PTK2) has been determined and ranked relative to previously used reference genes, i.e., GAPDH, β-actin and cyclophillin A/PPIA, using RefFinder and NormFinder algorithms. Finally, expression of selected target genes (luteal IL-1b and MHCII, placental COX2 and VEGFA, and uterine IGF2 and LHR) was re-evaluated and normalized. All proposed candidate reference genes were more stable, ranked higher and introduced less variation than previously used genes.
              
                Conclusions
                Based on our analyses, we recommend applying KDM4A and PTK2 for normalization of gene expression in the canine CL and placenta. The inclusion of a third reference gene, EIF4H, is suggested for healthy uteri. With this, the interpretation of qPCR data will be more reliable, allowing better understanding of canine reproductive physiology.

However, the expression of RGs is also variable depending on the experimental conditions, which may lead to false or contradictory conclusions upon normalization. Due to the current lack of information for a clear list of stable RGs in bovine MSCs, we conducted this study to identify suitable RGs in bovine MSCs.Methods: The cycle threshold values of ten traditionally used RGs (18S ribosomal RNA [18S], beta-2-microglobulin [B2M], H2A histone family, member Z [H2A], peptidylprolyl isomerase A [PPIA], ribosomal protein 4 [RPL4], succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A [SDHA], beta actin [ACTB], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH], TATA box binding protein [TBP], and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltrasnfrase1 [HPRT1]) in bovine bone marrow-derived MSCs (bBMMSCs) were validated for their stabilities using three types of RG evaluation algorithms (geNorm, Normfinder, and Bestkeeper). The effect of validated RGs was then verified by normalization of lineage-specific genes (fatty acid binding protein 4 [FABP4] and osteonectin [ON]) expressions during differentiations of bBMMSCs or POU class 5 homeobox 1 (OCT4) expression between bBMMSCs and dermal skins.Results: Based on the results obtained for the three most stable RGs from geNorm (TBP, RPL4, and H2A), Normfinder (TBP, RPL4, and SDHA), and Bestkeeper (TBP, RPL4, and SDHA), it was comprehensively determined that TBP and RPL4 were the most stable RGs in bBMMSCs. However, traditional RGs were suggested to be the least stable (18S) or moderately stable (GAPDH and ACTB) in bBMMSCs. Normalization of FABP4 or ON against TBP, RPL4, and 18S presented significant differences during differentiation of bBMMSCs. However, although significantly low expression of OCT4 was detected in dermal skins compared to that in bBMMSCs when TBP and RPL4 were used in normalization, normalization against 18S exhibited no significance.Conclusion: This study proposes that TBP and RPL4 were suitable as stable RGs for qPCR study in bovine MSCs.",Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences,2020

Data normalization against suitable reference genes is critical, yet their observed expression can be confounded by pseudogenes. Eight reference genes were selected based on literature review and analysis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) microarray data. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were followed by RT-qPCR amplification in triplicate with exon-junction or intron-spanning primers. Several statistical analyses were applied using Microsoft Excel, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. In normal tissues, the least correlation of variation (CqCV%) and the lowest maximum fold change (MFC) were respectively recorded for PYCR1 and SYMPK. In PTC tissues, SYMPK had the lowest CqCV% (5.16%) and MFC (1.17). According to NormFinder, the best reference combination was SYMPK and ACTB (stability value = 0.209). BestKeeper suggested SYMPK as the best reference in both normal (r = 0.969) and PTC tissues (r = 0.958). SYMPK is suggested as the best reference gene for overcoming the pseudogene problem in RT-qPCR data normalization, with a stability value of 0.319.",Scientific Reports,2020

Costé, F. Rouleux-Bonnin","AbstractBone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) have a critical role in tissue regeneration and in the hematopoietic niche due to their differentiation and self-renewal capacities. These mechanisms are finely tuned partly by small non-coding microRNA implicated in post-transcriptional regulation. The easiest way to quantify them is RT-qPCR followed by normalization on validated reference genes (RGs). This study identified appropriate RG for normalization of miRNA expression in BM-MSCs and HS27a and HS5 cell lines in various conditions including normoxia, hypoxia, co-culture, as model for the hematopoietic niche and after induced differentiation as model for regenerative medicine. Six candidates, namely miR-16-5p, miR-34b-3p, miR-103a-3p, miR-191-5p, let-7a-5p and RNU6A were selected and their expression verified by RT-qPCR. Next, a ranking on stability of the RG candidates were performed with two algorithms geNorm and RefFinder and the optimal number of RGs needed to normalize was determined. Our results indicate miR-191-5p as the most stable miRNA in all conditions but also that RNU6a, usually used as RG is the less stable gene. This study demonstrates the interest of rigorously evaluating candidate miRNAs as reference genes and the importance of the normalization process to study the expression of miRNAs in BM-MSCs or derived cell lines.",Scientific Reports,2020

                Background
                Oat (Avena sativa L.), a hexaploid crop with unknown genome, has valuable nutritional, medicinal and pharmaceutical uses. However, no suitable RGs (reference genes) for qPCR (quantitative real-time PCR) has been documented for oat yet. Single-copy gene is often selected as RG, which is challengeable or impactable in unexplored polyploids.
              
                Results
                In this study, eleven candidate RGs, including four duplicated genes, were selected from oat transcriptome. The stability and the optimal combination of these candidate RGs were assessed in 18 oat samples by using four statistical algorithms including the ΔCt method, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. The most stable RGs for “all samples”, “shoots and roots of seedlings”, “developing seeds” and “developing endosperms” were EIF4A (Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-3), UBC21 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme 21), EP (Expressed protein) and EIF4A respectively. Among these RGs, UBC21 was a four-copy duplicated gene. The reliability was validated by the expression patterns of four various genes normalized to the most and the least stable RGs in different sample sets.
              
                Conclusions
                Results provide a proof of concept that the duplicated RG is feasible for qPCR in polyploids. To our knowledge, this study is the first systematic research on the optimal RGs for accurate qPCR normalization of gene expression in different organs and tissues of oat.

However, there are no reference genes suitable for multiple species and under different experimental conditions. Nitraria tangutorum Bobr. is a typical plant native to desert areas. It is drought-resistant, saline-alkali resistant, extreme temperatures-resistant, and has strong adaptability. To date, the importance of this germplasm has not been sufficiently understood; therefore, it is still unclear which genes can be used as reference genes to calibrate qPCR data of N. tangutorum. In this study we analyzed the expression levels of 10 candidate reference genes (ACT, GAPDH, TUA, TUB, CYP, UBC, His, PP2A, HSP, and EF1-α) in N. tangutorum seedlings under a series of experimental conditions, including in different organs (root, stem, and leaf) and under abiotic stresses (salt, drought, heat, and cold) and hormone stimuli (abscisic acid) by qPCR. Three software programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to evaluate the expression stability of the ten genes. Comprehensive analysis showed that EF1-α and His had the best expression stability, whereas HSP was the least suitable as a reference gene. The expression profile of NtCER7, a gene related to the regulation of cuticular wax biosynthesis in N. tangutorum, verified the accuracy of the experimental results. Based on this study, we recommend EF1-α and His as suitable reference genes for N. tangutorum. This paper provides the first data on stable reference genes in N. tangutorum, which will be beneficial to studying the gene expression of N. tangutorum and other Nitraria species in the future.",Scientific Reports,2020

Duda, Serafeim Tsitsilonis, Johannes Keller, Denise Jahn","AbstractSystemic and local posttraumatic responses are often monitored on mRNA expression level using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), which requires normalisation to adjust for confounding sources of variability. Normalisation requests reference (housekeeping) genes stable throughout time and divergent experimental conditions in the tissue of interest, which are crucial for a reliable and reproducible gene expression analysis. Although previous animal studies analysed reference genes following isolated trauma, this multiple-trauma gene expression analysis provides a notable study analysing reference genes in primarily affected (i.e. bone/fracture callus and hypothalamus) and secondarily affected organs (i.e. white adipose tissue, liver, muscle and spleen), following experimental long bone fracture and traumatic brain injury. We considered tissue-specific and commonly used top-ranked reference candidates from different functional groups that were evaluated applying the established expression stability analysis tools NormFinder, GeNorm, BestKeeper and RefFinder. In conclusion, reference gene expression in primary organs is highly time point as well as tissue-specific, and therefore requires careful evaluation for qRT-PCR analysis. Furthermore, the general application of Ppia, particularly in combination with a second reference gene, is strongly recommended for the analysis of systemic effects in the case of indirect trauma affecting secondary organs through local and systemic pathophysiological responses.",Scientific Reports,2020

Using control and pinealectomized rats, we investigated the daily expression profile of Actb, Hprt-1, B2m, and Rpl37a, genes that are commonly used as reference genes for reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), in epididymal (EP), retroperitoneal (RP), and subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissues. In control rats, Actb expression presented a daily oscillation in all adipose tissues investigated, Hprt-1 showed 24-h fluctuations in only RP and SC depots, B2m was stable over 24 h for EP and RP but oscillated over 24 h in SC adipose tissue, and Rpl37a presented a daily oscillation in only RP fat. In the absence of melatonin, the rhythmicity of Actb in all adipose depots was abolished, the daily rhythmicity of Hprt-1 and B2m was disrupted in SC fat, the peak expression of Rpl37a and Hprt-1 was delayed, and the amplitude of Rpl37a was reduced in RP adipose tissue. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the expression of putative reference genes displays a daily rhythm influenced by melatonin levels in a manner specific to the adipose depot.

Thus, a careful evaluation of RGs prior to expression studies is essential.",Scientific Reports,2020

Gubser, Gunhild Unterstab, Yannic Lecoultre, Renato Paro, Christoph Hess","AbstractReverse-transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is widely used for mRNA quantification. To accurately measure changing gene transcript levels under different experimental conditions, the use of appropriate reference gene transcripts is instrumental. In T cell immunology, suitable reference genes have been reported for bulk CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. However, many CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets have been described in the past. Although they respond differently to given activation stimuli, proper validation of suitable reference genes in these subsets is lacking. In this study, we evaluated twelve commonly used reference gene products in human naïve (NV) and effector memory (EM) CD8+ T cells under non-activated and activated (2 h, 10 h and 20 h) conditions. We used five different statistical approaches for data analysis. Our results show that a number of widely used reference transcripts become differentially expressed under activating conditions. Using them as references markedly alters results as exemplified with IFNG mRNA expression. The only candidate reference gene products that remained stable during the activation process were 18S rRNA and SDHA mRNA, encouraging their usage as reference gene products for RT-qPCR experiments, when quantifying mRNA levels in human NV and EM CD8+ T cells.",Scientific Reports,2020

Background
Anisakis simplex s. s. is a parasitic nematode with a complex life cycle in which humans can become accidental hosts by consuming raw or not fully cooked fish containing L3 larvae. The growing popularity of raw fish dishes has contributed to an increase in the incidence of anisakiasis, which has spurred scientific efforts to develop new methods for diagnosing and treating the disease and also to investigate the gene expression at different developmental stages of this parasite. The identification of reference genes suitable for the normalization of RT-qPCR data has not been studied with respect to A. simplex s. s.

Methods
In the present study, eight candidate reference genes were analyzed in A. simplex s. s. at two different developmental stages: L3 and L4. The expression stability of these genes was assessed by geNorm and NormFinder softwares.

Results
In general, our results identified translation elongation factor 1α (ef-1α) and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase 12 (ppi12) as the most stable genes in L3 and L4 developmental stages of A. simplex s. s. Validation of the selected reference genes was performed by profiling the expression of the nuclear hormone receptor gene (nhr 48) in different developmental stages.

Conclusions
This first analysis selecting suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR in A. simplex s. s. will facilitate future functional analyses and deep mining of genetic resources in this parasitic nematode.

Pinheiro, Blair D. Siegfried","AbstractThe pepper weevil, Anthonomus eugenii Cano (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is the main insect pest of peppers (Capsicum spp.) throughout the southern U.S. and a potential target for novel control methods that may require gene expression analyses. Careful selection of adequate reference genes to normalize RT-qPCR data is an important prerequisite for gene expression studies since the expression stability of reference genes can be affected by the experimental conditions leading to biased or erroneous results. The lack of studies on validation of reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis in A. eugenii limits the investigation of gene expression, therefore it is needed a systematic selection of suitable reference genes for data normalization. In the present study, three programs (BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder) were used to analyze the expression stability of candidate reference genes (β-ACT, ArgK, EF1-α, GAPDH, RPL12, RPS23, α-TUB, 18S and 28S) in A. eugenii under different experimental conditions. Our results revealed that the most stably expressed reference genes in A. eugenii varied according to the experimental condition evaluated: developmental stages (EF1-α, 18S and RPL12), sex (RPS23 and RPL12), low temperature (GAPDH and α-TUB), high temperature (α-TUB and RPS23), all temperatures (α-TUB and GAPDH), starvation (RPL12 and α-TUB), and dsRNA exposure (α-TUB and RPL12). Our study provides for the first time valuable information on appropriate reference genes that can be used in the analysis of gene expression by RT-qPCR in biological experiments involving A. eugenii.",Scientific Reports,2020

In flowering plants, male gametes are produced in anthers, being encased in pollen grains. Understanding the genetic regulation of meiosis key events such as chromosome recognition and pairing, synapsis and recombination, is needed to manipulate chromosome associations for breeding purposes, particularly in important cereal crops like wheat. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely used to analyse gene expression and to validate the results obtained by other transcriptomic analyses, like RNA-seq. Selection and validation of appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization is essential to obtain reproducible and accurate expression data. In this work, twelve candidate reference genes were evaluated using the mainstream algorithms geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper and ΔCt, then ranked from most to least suitable for normalization with RefFinder. Different sets of reference genes were recommended to normalize gene expression data in anther meiosis of bread and durum wheat, their corresponding genotypes in the absence of the Ph1 locus and for comparative studies among wheat genotypes. Comparisons between meiotic (anthers) and somatic (leaves and roots) wheat tissues were also carried out. To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first comprehensive list of reference genes for robust RT-qPCR normalization to study differentially expressed genes during male meiosis in wheat in a breeding framework.",Scientific Reports,2020

In the present study, we measured the mRNA transcriptional levels of ten candidate RGs under five experimental conditions; these genes have been identified as stable RGs in tea plants. By using the ΔCt method, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, CLATHRIN1 and UBC1, TUA1 and SAND1, or SAND1 and UBC1 were identified as the best combination for normalizing diurnal gene expression in leaves, stems and roots individually; CLATHRIN1 and GAPDH1 were identified as the best combination for jasmonic acid treatment; ACTIN1 and UBC1 were identified as the best combination for Toxoptera aurantii-infested leaves; UBC1 and GAPDH1 were identified as the best combination for Empoasca onukii-infested leaves; and SAND1 and TBP1 were identified as the best combination for Ectropis obliqua regurgitant-treated leaves. Furthermore, our results suggest that if the processing time of the treatment was long, the best RGs for normalization should be recommended according to the stability of the proposed RGs in different time intervals when intragroup differences were compared, which would strongly increase the accuracy and sensitivity of target gene expression in tea plants under biotic stresses. However, when the differences of intergroup were compared, the RGs for normalization should keep consistent across different time points. The results of this study provide a technical guidance for further study of the molecular mechanisms of tea plants under different biotic stresses.",Scientific Reports,2020

               Accurate quantitation of gene expression levels require sensitive, precise and reproducible measurements of specific transcripts. Normalization to a reference gene is the most common practice to minimize the impact of the uncontrolled variation. The fundamental prerequisite for an accurate reference gene is to be stably expressed amongst all the samples included in the analysis. In the present study we aimed to assess the expression level and stability of a panel of 21 genes in Yarrowia lipolytica throughout varying conditions, covering composition of the culturing medium, growth phase and strain—wild type and recombinant burdened with heterologous protein overexpression. The panel of the selected candidate genes covered those essential for growth and maintenance of metabolism and homologs of commonly used internal references in RT-qPCR. The candidate genes expression level and stability were assessed and the data were processed using dedicated computational tools (geNorm and NormFinder). The results obtained here indicated genes unaffected by the burden of overexpression (TEF1, TPI1, UBC2, SRPN2, ALG9-like, RYL1) or by the culture medium used (ACT1, TPI1, UBC2, SEC61, ODC, CLA4, FKS1, TPS1), as well as those the least (SSDH, ODC, GPD) and the most (SEC62, TPI1, IPP1) suitable for normalization of RT-qPCR data in Y. lipolytica.",FEMS Yeast Research,2020

Bowen","European canker, caused by the necrotrophic fungal phytopathogenNeonectria ditissima, is one of the most damaging apple diseases worldwide. An understanding of the molecular basis ofN.ditissimavirulence is currently lacking. Identification of genes with an up-regulation of expression during infection, which are therefore probably involved in virulence, is a first step towards this understanding. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) can be used to identify these candidate virulence genes, but relies on the use of reference genes for relative gene expression data normalisation. However, no report that addresses selecting appropriate fungal reference genes for use in theN.ditissima-apple pathosystem has been published to date. In this study, eightN.ditissimagenes were selected as candidate RT-qPCR reference genes for gene expression analysis. A subset of the primers (six) designed to amplify regions from these genes were specific forN.ditissima, failing to amplify PCR products with template from other fungal pathogens present in the apple orchard. The efficiency of amplification of these six primer sets was satisfactory, ranging from 81.8 to 107.53%. Analysis of expression stability when a highly pathogenicN.ditissimaisolate was cultured under 10 regimes, using the statistical algorithms geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, indicated thatactinandmyo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase(mips), or their combination, could be utilised as the most suitable reference genes for normalisation ofN.ditissimagene expression.

Gene expression analysis of the conceptus and maternal reproductive tissues is a favourable method to assess the embryonic maternal interaction. The reliability of the commonly used method reverse transcription‐quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR) depends on proper normalization to stable reference genes (RGs). The objective of this study was to determine the expression stability of 10 potential RGs in maternal reproductive tissues and foetal tissues, and to analyse the effect of RG selection on the calculation of the relative expression of target genes. The expression stability of 10 potential RGs was analysed in eight different tissues from three pregnant dairy cows. Three programs—GeNorm, NormFinder and Bestkeeper—were used to identify the best RGs. According to all three programs, the most stable RG was CNOT11, whereas the least stable RGs were GAPDH and HPRT1. GeNorm analysis showed that a combination of five RGs (SDHA, PPIA, CNOT11, RPS9 and RPL19) was necessary for appropriate data normalization. However, NormFinder analysis indicated that the combination of CNOT11 and PPIA was the most suitable. When target genes were normalized to these RGs, the relative expression of the Radical S‐adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 gene was not affected by the choice of RGs, whereas a large difference was observed in the expression profile of the Nuclear erythroid2‐related factor 2 gene between the most stable and least stable RGs.

Background
Before studying gene expression of different organisms, it is important to determine the best reference gene. At present, the most accurate method of detecting gene expression is quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). With this method, reference genes that are stable in different biological systems and under different conditions can be obtained. Toona ciliata Roem (T. ciliata). is a valuable and fast-growing timber specie. In this study, 20 reference genes were identified using RT-qPCR, as a primary prerequisite for future gene expression analysis. Four different methods, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RankAggreg were used to evaluate the expression stability of the 20 candidate reference genes in various tissues under different conditions.

Results
The experimental results showed that TUB-α was the most stably expressed reference gene across all samples and UBC17 was the most stable in leaves and young stems under Hypsipyla robusta (H. robusta) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatments. In addition, PP2C59 and UBC5B were the best-performing genes in leaves under H. robusta treatment, while HIS1 and ACT7 were the best reference genes in young stems. The two best reference genes were 60S-18 and TUB-α after treatment at 4 °C. The expression of HIS6 and MUB1 was the most stable under PEG6000 treatment. The accuracy of the selected reference genes was verified using the transcription factor MYB3 (TcMYB3) gene.

Conclusions
This is the first report to verify the best reference genes for normalizing gene expression in T. ciliata under different conditions, which will facilitate future elucidation of gene regulations in this species.

Markedly, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in ovine embryos currently lacks HKGs. Therefore, we tested 11 HKGs for RT-qPCR normalization during ovine parthenogenetic preimplantation development. Seven HKGs reached the qPCR efficiency threshold (97.20–105.96%), with correlation coefficients ranging from −0.922 to −0.998 and slopes from −3.22 to −3.59. GeNorm ranked glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and TATA-binding protein (TBP) as the best HKG pair, while H3 histone, family 3A (H3F3A) was the third HKG. Relative gene expression was measured for zinc finger protein X-linked (ZFX) and developmental pluripotency-associated 3 (DPPA3) transcripts during ovine parthenogenetic preimplantation development. ZFX did not show any transcript abundance fluctuation among oocytes, cleavage-stage embryos, and morulae. DPPA3 transcript abundance was also similar among all developmental stages, therefore suggesting that it may not display a maternal gene expression profile. In silico analysis of ovine DPPA3 mRNA and protein showed high conservation to bovine orthologues. However, DPPA3 orthologues differed in regulatory motifs. In conclusion, GAPDH, TBP and H3F3A are stable HKGs in ovine parthenogenetic embryos and allow accurate RT-qPCR-based gene expression analysis.",Zygote,2020

Background
MCF-7 breast cancer cell line is undoubtedly amongst the most extensively studied patient-derived research models, providing pivotal results that have over the decades translated to constantly improving patient care. Many research groups, have previously identified suitable reference genes for qPCR normalization in MCF-7 cell line. However, over the course of identification of suitable reference genes, a comparative analysis comprising these genes together in a single study has not been reported. Furthermore, the expression dynamics of these reference genes within sub-clones cultured over multiple passages (p) has attracted limited attention from research groups. Therefore, we investigated the expression dynamics of 12 previously suggested reference genes within two sub-clones (culture A1 and A2) cultured identically over multiple passages. Additionally, the effect of nutrient stress on reference gene expression was examined to postulate an evidence-based recommendation of the least variable reference genes that could be employed in future gene expression studies.

Results
The analysis revealed the presence of differential reference gene expression within the sub-clones of MCF-7. In culture A1, GAPDH-CCSER2 were identified as the least variable reference genes while for culture A2, GAPDH-RNA28S were identified. However, upon validation using genes of interest, both these pairs were found to be unsuitable control pairs. Normalization of AURKA and KRT19 with triplet pair GAPDH-CCSER2-PCBP1 yielded successful results. The triplet also proved its capability to handle variations arising from nutrient stress.

Conclusions
The variance in expression behavior amongst sub-clones highlights the potential need for exercising caution while selecting reference genes for MCF-7. GAPDH-CCSER2-PCBP1 triplet offers a reliable alternative to otherwise traditionally used internal controls for optimizing intra- and inter-assay gene expression differences. Furthermore, we suggest avoiding the use of ACTB, GAPDH and PGK1 as single internal controls.

                Background
                Reference genes are usually stably expressed in various cells and tissues. However, it was reported that the expression of some reference genes may be distinct in different species. In this study, we intend to answer whether the expression of reported traditional reference genes changes or not in the polyploid fish
              
                Results
                By retrieving the mRNA sequencing data of three different ploidy fish from the NCBI SRA database, we selected 12 candidate reference genes, and examined their expression levels in the 10 tissues and in the four cell lines of three different ploidy fish by real-time PCR. Then, the expression profiles of these 12 candidate reference genes were systematically evaluated by using the software platforms: BestKeeper, NormFinder and geNorm.
              
                Conclusion
                The 28S ribosomal protein S5 gene (RPS5) and the ribosomal protein S18 gene (RPS18) are the most suitable reference genes for the polyploid of Cyprinus carpio and Carassius auratus, demonstrated by both of the tissues and the cultured cells.

In order to acquire reliable and repeatable results, the use of a suitable internal reference gene to normalize the RT-qPCR data is essential. In this study, we reported the validation of housekeeping genes to identify the most suitable internal reference gene(s) for normalization of qPCR data obtained among different tissues (bud, leaf, cambium region) under different hormone stresses. Here, ΔCt, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper analyses were carried out to analyze the normalization of qPCR data of twenty-one reference gene families (ACT, CAC, CYP, EF1α, eIF, FPS1, FBK, GAPDH, RAN, PEPKR1, PP2A, RPL, RPS, RuBP, SAMDC, TEF, Tub-α, Tub-β, UBCE, UBQ, UPL) including 43 genes. The results showed that FPS1, RPL, and FBK were the most stable reference genes across all of the tested samples. In addition, the expression of NcEXPA8, one gene of interest that plays an important role in regulating cell wall extension, under different phytohormone stresses was used to further confirm the validated reference genes. Taken together, our results provide guidelines for reference gene selection under different phytohormone stresses and a foundation for more accurate and widespread use of RT-qPCR in N. cadamba.",Forests,2020

However, there is limited genetic data regarding this species. Selection of proper reference genes (RGs) for reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) data normalization has become an essential step in gene expression analysis. In this study, we aimed to examine expression stability of nine candidate RGs in C. muskingumensis plants, subjected to osmotic stress, generated either by salinity or PEG treatment. The identification of genes exhibiting high expression stability was performed by four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and deltaCt method). The results showed that the combination of two genes would be sufficient for reliable expression data normalization. ADP (ADP-ribosylation factor) and TBP (TATA-box-binding protein) were identified as the most stably expressed under salinity treatment, while eIF4A (eukaryotic initiation factor 4A) and TBP were found to show the highest stability under PEG-induced drought. A set of three genes (ADP, eIF4A and TBP) displayed the highest expression stability across all experimental samples tested in this study. To our best knowledge, this is the first report regarding RGs selection in C. muskingumensis.

Here, we present a simplified and easy-to-handle, but reliable and valid method for simulating static isotropic tensile strain in vitro using spherical silicone cap stamps. Furthermore, we identify appropriate reference genes for data normalization in real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) experiments on PDLF subjected to tensile strain.Materials and methodsPDLF were cultivated on flexible bioflex membranes and exposed to static isotropic tensile strain of different magnitudes and timeframes. We determined cell number, cytotoxicity, and relative expression of proinflammatory genes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). For normalization of RT-qPCR data, we tested the stability and validity of nine candidate reference genes with four mathematical algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, comparative ΔCq, and BestKeeper) and ranked them based on their calculated expression stability.ResultsWe observed no decrease in cell number or cytotoxic effect at any of the applied magnitudes and timeframes of tensile strain. At 16 per cent and 35 per cent tensile strain for 48 hours, we detected a significant increase in COX-2 and decrease in IL-6 gene expression. Highest stability was found for TBP (TATA-box-binding protein) and PPIB (peptidylprolyl isomerase A) in reference gene validation. According to the geNorm algorithm, both genes in conjunction are sufficient for normalization. In contrast to all other candidate genes tested, gene expression normalization of target gene COX-2 to reference genes EEF1A1, RPL22, and RNA18S5 indicated no significant upregulation of COX-2 expression.ConclusionsA strain magnitude of 16 per cent for 48 hours elicited the most distinct cellular response by PDLF subjected to static tensile isotropic strain by the presented method. TBP and PPIB in conjunction proved to be the most appropriate reference genes to normalize target gene expression in RT-qPCR studies on PDLF subjected to tensile strain.",European Journal of Orthodontics,2019

Involved in Five Abiotic Stresses,"Qi Pu, Zhou Li, Gang Nie, Jiqiong Zhou, Lin Liu, Yan Peng","White clover (Trifolium repens L.) is a widely cultivated cool-season perennial forage legume in temperate grassland systems. Many studies have analyzed the gene expression in this grass species using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The selection of stable reference genes for qRT-PCR is crucial. However, there was no detailed study on reference genes in different tissues of white clover under various abiotic stress conditions. Herein, 14 candidate reference genes (ACT7, ACT101, TUA1109, TUB, CYP, 60SrRNA, UBQ, E3, GAPDH1, GAPDH2, PP2A, BAM3, SAMDC, and ABC) were selected and analyzed by four programs (GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder). Samples were taken from two tissues (leaves and roots) under five different abiotic stresses (drought, salt, heat, cold, and heavy metal stress). Our results showed that 60SrRNA and ACT101 were the two top-ranked genes for all samples. Under various experimental conditions, the most stable gene was different; however, SAMDC, UBQ, 60SrRNA, and ACT101 were always top ranked. The most suitable reference genes should be selected according to different plant tissues and growth conditions.

Hampton, Katja Koeppen, Laura Bashor, Bruce A. Stanton"," Most quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments report differential expression relative to the expression of one or more reference genes. Therefore, when experimental conditions alter reference gene expression, qPCR results may be compromised. Little is known about the magnitude of this problem in practice. We found that reference gene responses are common and hard to predict and that their stability should be demonstrated in each experiment. Our reanalysis of 15 airway epithelia microarray data sets retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) identified no common reference gene that was reliable in all 15 studies. Reanalysis of published RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data in which human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) were exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed that minor experimental details, including bacterial strain, may alter reference gene responses. Direct measurement of 32 TaqMan reference genes in primary cultures of HBEC exposed to P. aeruginosa (strain PA14) demonstrated that choosing an unstable reference gene could make it impossible to observe statistically significant changes in IL8 gene expression. We found that reference gene instability is a general phenomenon and not limited to studies of airway epithelial cells. In a diverse compendium of 986 human microarray experiments retrieved from the NCBI, reference genes were differentially expressed in 42% of studies. Experimentally induced changes in reference gene expression ranged from 21% to 212%. These results highlight the importance of identifying adequate reference genes for each experimental system and documenting their response to treatment in each experiment.

It is essential to identify reference genes which have stable expression throughout gestation in feto‐placental units associated with foetuses of different size and sex. qPCR was performed for 11 genes within porcine placentae and endometria at gestational days (GD) 30, 60 and 90. Several reference genes were found to have stable expression in these samples. The combination of B2m1 and Tbp1, and Hprt1 and Tbp1 had the most stable expression in endometria and placentae, respectively. Reference genes identified as having stable expression were utilized in a larger experiment with placentae and endometria associated with foetuses of different size and sex at four GD. The average expression of B2m1 and Tbp1 mRNAs was suitable for the normalization of temporal changes in endometria, and comparison between endometria supplying foetuses of different size throughout gestation. The average expression of Hprt1 and Tbp1 mRNAs was suitable for the normalization of placental mRNA expression for comparison of temporal changes and sex differences between placentae supplying foetuses of different sex throughout gestation. This combination was suitable for the normalization of mRNA expression in placentas supplying GD30, GD60 and GD90 foetuses of different size.

The stability of fourteen candidate reference genes was evaluated by BestKeeper, GeNorm, NormFinder, and RefFinder software. Our results identified U2AF as the best reference gene in Cd, Hg, Cr, and As treated leaves as well as in Hg, Pb, As, and Cr stressed root tissues. In Pb treated leaf tissues, 18S rRNA was demonstrated to be the best reference gene. CYP5 was determined to be the optimal reference gene in Cd treated root tissues.

Background
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is one of the most common and accurate methods of gene expression analysis. However, the biggest challenge for this kind of examinations is normalization of the results, which requires the application of dependable internal controls. The selection of appropriate reference genes (RGs) is one of the most crucial points in qPCR data analysis and for correct assessment of gene expression. Because of the fact that many reports indicate that the expression profiles of typically used RGs can be unstable in certain experimental conditions, species or tissues, reference genes with stable expression levels should be selected individually for each experiment. In this study, we analysed a set of ten candidate RGs for wheat seedlings under short-term drought stress. Our tests included five ‘traditional’ RGs (GAPDH, ACT, UBI, TUB, and TEF1) and five novel genes developed by the RefGenes tool from the Genevestigator database.

Results
Expression stability was assessed using five different algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, RefFinder and the delta Ct method. In the final ranking, we identified three genes: CJ705892, ACT, and UBI, as the best candidates for housekeeping genes. However, our data indicated a slight variation between the different algorithms that were used. We revealed that the novel gene CJ705892, obtained by means of in silico analysis, showed the most stable expression in the experimental tissue and condition.

Conclusions
Our results support the statement, that novel genes selected for certain experimental conditions have a more stable level of expression in comparison to routinely applied RGs, like genes encoding actin, tubulin or GAPDH. Selected CJ705892 gene can be used as a housekeeping gene in the expression analysis in wheat seedlings under short-term drought. The results of our study will be useful for subsequent analyses of gene expression in wheat tissues subjected to drought.

The DT40 was derived from bursal lymphoma cells that were subjected to RAV-1 bird retroviral infection. It is a simplified in vitro model that allows tracking the direct interaction of stimulants on the lymphoid population and profiling of the hepatocellular B cell transcriptome. The reference gene analysis was carried out using statistical tools integrating four independent methods—geNorm, Best Keeper, NormFinder, delta Ct and RefFinder. Based on the selected reference genes, the relative gene expression analysis was done using the ddCt method. Complete relative gene expression study on a panel of the target genes revealed that proper selection of reference genes depending on the tissue eliminate decreases in data quality. The SDHA and RPL4 genes constitute stable internal controls as reference genes when analyzing gene expression in the DT40 cell line.",Genes,2020

Morley, John N. Plevris, Peter C. Hayes","Gene expression analysis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is routinely used in biomedical studies. The reproducibility and reliability of the data fundamentally depends on experimental design and data interpretation. Despite the wide application of this assay, there is significant variation in the validation process of gene expression data from research laboratories. Since the validity of results depends on appropriate normalisation, it is crucial to select appropriate reference gene(s), where transcription of the selected gene is unaffected by experimental setting. In this study we have applied geNorm technology to investigate the transcription of 12 ‘housekeeping’ genes for use in the normalisation of RT-qPCR data acquired using a widely accepted HepaRG hepatic cell line in studies examining models of pre-clinical drug testing. geNorm data identified a number of genes unaffected by specific drug treatments and showed that different genes remained invariant in response to different drug treatments, whereas the transcription of ‘classical’ reference genes such as GAPDH (glyceralde- hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was altered by drug treatment. Comparing data normalised using the reference genes identified by geNorm with normalisation using classical housekeeping genes demonstrated substantial differences in the final results. In light of cell therapy application, RT-qPCR analyses has to be carefully evaluated to accurately interpret data obtained from dynamic cellular models undergoing sequential stages of phenotypic change.",Cells,2020

Studying transcription factors and genes involved in T-cell differentiation and maturation during the fetal and neonatal periods is very important. Nevertheless, no studies to date have been interested in evaluating the expressions of housekeeping genes as internal controls to assess the varying expressions of different genes inside this tissue during that period or in the context of viral infection. Thus, we evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) the expression of the most common internal control genes in the thymus of Swiss albino mice during the fetal and neonatal period, and following in utero infection with Coxsackievirus B4. The stability of expression of these reference genes in different samples was investigated using the geNorm application. Results demonstrated that the expression stability varied greatly between genes. Oaz1 was found to have the highest stability in different stages of development, as well as following Coxsackievirus B4 infection. The current study clearly demonstrated that Oaz1, with very stable expression levels that outperformed other tested housekeeping genes, could be used as a reference gene in the thymus and thymic epithelial cells during development and following Coxsackievirus B4 infection.",Genes,2020

               Apolygus lucorum (Meyer-Dür) is a destructive pest to &amp;gt;280 plants. Major economic significance and pesticide resistance issues have created a need for integrated pest management (e.g., RNAi, entomopathogen-based bioinsecticides) for A. lucorum. To better develop these control strategies, large-scale genetic studies involving gene-expression analysis are required and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most commonly used method. However, there have been no reports on appropriate reference genes in A. lucorum. Here, we evaluated nine widely utilized reference genes including EF1γ, RPL32, RPL27, SDH, TBP, ACT, ACT2, GAPDH, and βTUB for their expression stabilities in A. lucorum under five different conditions i.e., life stage, tissue, sex, dsRNA injection, and entomopathogen infection. Based on the gene stability ranking calculated by RefFinder, which integrates four algorithms (geNorm, delta Ct method, NormFinder, and BestKeeper), we recommend RPL27 and RPL32 as the most appropriate reference genes for molecular studies in different life stages and tissues; GAPDH and EF1γ for different sexes and entomopathogen infection studies; and RPL27 and EF1γ for RNAi studies. The results of this study will help improve the accuracy and reliability for normalizing the RT-qPCR data for further molecular analysis in A. lucorum.",Journal of Economic Entomology,2019

The selection of appropriate reference genes is necessary for the normalization of gene expression determination during quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) experiments. In this study, qRT-PCR was used to study gene expression. Three software packages geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper were used, and a comprehensive ranking of candidate reference genes was produced based on their output to evaluate the expression stability of 16 candidate reference genes from L. olgensis under drought, salt, cold, and heat stress. PP2A-1 and GAPDH ranked as the most stable reference genes under drought and cold stress, PP2A-1 and UBQ10 were most stable under salt stress, and TIP41 and ACT2 were most stable under heat stress. The least stable gene was ADP, which ranked the last under all treatments. Expression profile analysis of the antioxidant gene CAT using the two most stable and the single least stable reference genes under each stress further verified that the selected reference genes were suitable for gene expression normalization.

                Background
                RNA sequencing allows the measuring of gene expression at a resolution unmet by expression arrays or RT-qPCR. It is however necessary to normalize sequencing data by library size, transcript size and composition, among other factors, before comparing expression levels. The use of internal control genes or spike-ins is advocated in the literature for scaling read counts, but the methods for choosing reference genes are mostly targeted at RT-qPCR studies and require a set of pre-selected candidate controls or pre-selected target genes.
              
                Results
                Here, we report an R-based pipeline to select internal control genes based solely on read counts and gene sizes. This novel method first normalizes the read counts to Transcripts per Million (TPM) and then excludes weakly expressed genes using the DAFS script to calculate the cut-off. It then selects as references the genes with lowest TPM coefficient of variation. We used this method to pick custom reference genes for the differential expression analysis of three transcriptome sets from transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing heterologous fungal effector proteins tagged with GFP (using GFP alone as the control). The custom reference genes showed lower coefficient of variation and fold change as well as a broader range of expression levels than commonly used reference genes. When analyzed with NormFinder, both typical and custom reference genes were considered suitable internal controls, but the custom selected genes were more stably expressed. geNorm produced a similar result in which most custom selected genes ranked higher (i.e. were more stably expressed) than commonly used reference genes.
              
                Conclusions
                The proposed method is innovative, rapid and simple. Since it does not depend on genome annotation, it can be used with any organism, and does not require pre-selected reference candidates or target genes that are not always available.

This technique is highly dependent on the validation of reference genes, which exhibit stable expression levels among experimental conditions. Often, reference genes are assumed to be stable a priori without a rigorous test of gene stability. However, such an oversight can easily lead to misinterpreting expression levels of target genes if the references genes are in fact not stable across experimental conditions. Even though most gene expression studies focus on just one species, comparative studies of gene expression among closely related species can be very informative from an evolutionary perspective. In our study, we have attempted to find stable reference genes for four closely related species of grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) that together exhibit a spectrum of density-dependent phenotypic plasticity. Gene stability was assessed for eight reference genes in two tissues, two experimental conditions and all four species. We observed clear differences in the stability ranking of these reference genes, both between tissues and between species. Additionally, the choice of reference genes clearly influenced the results of a gene expression experiment. We offer suggestions for the use of reference genes in further studies using these four species, which should be taken as a cautionary tale for future studies involving RT-qPCR in a comparative framework.",PeerJ,2020

In this study, we investigated the expression level of ten candidate reference genes in hepatoma carcinoma cell (HepG2) and human hepatocyte cell line (L02) treated with ethanol (EtOH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), acetaminophen (APAP), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), respectively. To analyze raw cycle threshold values (Cp values) from qPCR run, three reference gene validation programs, including Bestkeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder, were used to evaluate the stability of ten candidate reference genes. The results showed that TATA‐box binding protein (TBP) and tubulin beta 2a (TUBB2a) presented the highest stability for normalization under different treatments and were regarded as the most suitable reference genes of HepG2 and L02. In addition, this study not only identified the most stable reference genes of each treatment, but also suggested that β‐actin (ACTB), glyceraldehade‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), tyrosine 3‐monooxygenase/tryptophan 5‐monooxygenase activation protein zeta (YWHAZ), and beta‐2 microglobulin (B2M) were the least stable reference genes in HepG2 and L02.

In order to precisely evaluate the relative expression of genes in the cells of mice suffering from Kidney Yang Deficiency Syndrome (KYDS) in response to influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1 using RT‐qPCR, it is crucial to identify reliable reference genes. In the present study, 15 candidate reference genes (Actb, β2m, Gapdh, Gusb, Tuba, Grcc10, Eif4h, Rnf187, Nedd8, Ywhae, 18S rRNA, Rpl13, Ubc, Rpl32, and Ppia) were investigated in lung cells from KYDS mice infected with IAV H1N1. NormFinder, BestKeeper, and GeNorm were used to assess the stability of reference genes. The results were authenticated over extended experimental settings by a group of 10 samples. In the present study, we explored a novel method using dual‐gene combinations; the difference in gene expression between the model and normal control groups was statistically analyzed by an independent‐samples t‐test, and the difference in the mean value between the two groups was compared. A P value &gt; 0.05 and the lowest absolute value of the difference indicated the optimal reference two‐gene combination. Four additional host innate immune system‐related genes (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and RIG‐I) were analyzed together with the two treatment datasets to confirm the selected reference genes. Our results indicated that none of these 15 candidate reference genes can be used as reference gene individually for relative quantitative fluorescence PCR analysis; however, the combination of Grcc10 and Ppia, based on the process of calculating the higher P value and lower difference values between groups, was the best choice as a reference gene for the lung tissue samples in KYDS mice infected with IAV.

Here, 15 candidate reference genes were selected from R. yunnanensis transcriptome database and analyzed under abiotic stresses, hormone treatments, and different tissues. Among these 15 candidate reference genes, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP), TATA binding protein (TBP), ribosomal protein L5 (RPL5), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1α) were indicated as the five most stable reference genes by four statistical programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder). Ultimately, the validity of reference genes was confirmed by normalizing the expression of o-succinylbenzoate-CoA ligase (OSBL) and isochorismate synthase (ICS) involved in the anthraquinone biosynthesis pathway in different tissues and hormone treatments. Meanwhile, four other putative genes involved in the anthraquinone biosynthesis pathway were also normalized with the selected reference genes, which showed similar expression levels with those given by transcriptome data.

The following RGs were tested: common housekeeping genes of basal cell metabolism (Gapdh, Hprt1, Mapk6) and protein translation (Rpl29, Eef1a1, Eif2b2), as well as newly designed RGs (Gpatch1, Gorasp1, Cds2) selected according to the RefGenes tool of GeneVestigator. The stability of RGs was assessed by geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. All three applets favored Gapdh and Eef1a1 as the most stable genes in SC during development. In both models of SCI, Eif2b2 displayed the highest stability of expression, followed by Gapdh and Gorasp1/Hprt1 in cSCI, and Gapdh and Eef1a1 in the mSCI experiments. To verify our results, selected RGs were employed for normalization of the expression of genes with a clear biological context in the SC—Gfap and Slc1a3/Glast during postnatal development and Aif1/Iba1 and Cd68/Ed1 after SCI.",Brain Sciences,2019

Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is one of the most common methods used for quantification of miRNA expression, and the levels of expression are normalized by comparing with reference genes. Thus, the selection of reference genes is critically important for accurate quantification. The present study was intended to identify appropriate miRNA reference genes for normalizing the level of miRNA expression in Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck and Citrus reticulata Blanco infected by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, which caused citrus canker disease. Five algorithms (Delta Ct, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder) were used for screening reference genes, and two quantification approaches, poly(A) extension RT-qPCR and stem-loop RT-qPCR, were used to determine the most appropriate method for detecting expression patterns of miRNA. An overall comprehensive ranking output derived from the multi-algorithms showed that poly(A)-tailed miR162-3p/miR472 were the best reference gene combination for miRNA RT-qPCR normalization in citrus canker research. Candidate reference gene expression profiles determined by poly(A) RT-qPCR were more consistent in the two citrus species. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic comparison of two miRNA quantification methods for evaluating reference genes. These results highlight the importance of rigorously assessing candidate reference genes and clarify some contradictory results in miRNA research on citrus.",Genes,2019

Relative quantification of gene expression is the preferred method for quantitative validation of potential biomarkers. However, this approach relies on robust tissue-specific reference genes. In the melanoma field, this has been an obstacle due to lack of validated reference genes. Accordingly, we aimed to identify robust reference genes for normalization of gene expression in melanoma. The robustness of 24 candidate reference genes was evaluated across 80 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded melanomas of different thickness, −/+ ulceration, −/+ reported cases of metastases and of different BRAF mutation status using quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of the same genes and their robustness as normalizers was furthermore evaluated across a number of melanoma cell lines. We show that housekeeping genes like GAPDH do not qualify as stand-alone normalizers of genes expression in melanoma. Instead, we have as the first identified a panel of robust reference genes for normalization of gene expression in melanoma tumors and cultured melanoma cells. We recommend using a geometric mean of the expression of CLTA, MRPL19 and ACTB for normalization of gene expression in melanomas and a geometric mean of the expression of CASC3 and RPS2 for normalization of gene expression in melanoma cell lines. Normalization, according to our recommendation will allow for quantitative validation of potential novel melanoma biomarkers by quantitative real-time PCR.",Melanoma Research,2020

                Background
                In the present study, we evaluated four commonly used housekeeping genes, viz., actin-β, elongation factor-1α (EF1α), acidic ribosomal protein (ARP), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as internal references for quantitative analysis of immune genes in nervous necrosis virus (NNV)-infected seven-band grouper, Hyporthodus septemfasciatus.
              
                Methods
                Expression profiles of the four genes were estimated in 12 tissues of healthy and infected seven-band grouper. Expression stability of the genes was calculated using the delta Ct method, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and geNorm algorithms. Consensus ranking was performed using RefFinder, and statistical analysis was done using GraphpadPrism 5.0.
              
                Results
                Tissue-specific variations were observed in the four tested housekeeping genes of healthy and NNV-infected seven-band grouper. Fold change calculation for interferon-1 and Mx expression using the four housekeeping genes as internal references presented varied profiles for each tissue. EF1α and actin-β was the most stable expressed gene in tissues of healthy and NNV-infected seven-band grouper, respectively. Consensus ranking using RefFinder suggested EF1α as the least variable and highly stable gene in the healthy and infected animals.
              
                Conclusions
                These results suggest that EF1α can be a fairly better internal reference in comparison to other tested genes in this study during the NNV infection process. This forms the pilot study on the validation of reference genes in Hyporthodus septemfasciatus, in the context of NNV infection.

            Background and aims
            Persimmon (Diospyros kaki) is an economically
              important fruit tree species with complex flowering characteristics. To obtain
              accurate expression pattern analysis results, it is vital to select a reliable gene
              for the normalization of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction data. The
              aim of this study was to identify the optimal internal control gene among six
              candidate genes for gene expression analysis in different persimmon organs and
              developmental stages.
          
          
            Materials and methods
            This analysis was conducted using geNorm and NormFinder software to show
              differences in the stability of the six reference genes among tissues and floral
              developmental stages of the same plant.
          
          
            Results
            Although genes that exhibited moderate expression in NormFinder revealed
              slightly different expression stabilities than those obtained by geNorm, both sets of
              results showed that GAPDH was the best reference gene in
              different organs and floral buds at different developmental stages, whereas
                18SrRNA was the least stable gene.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Based on the overall ranking, GAPDH is the most
              suitable reference gene and is highly recommended for gene expression studies in
              different organs and different developmental stages of persimmon. This study provides
              useful reference data for future gene expression studies and will contribute to

For effective qPCR analyses, suitable reference genes are needed for normalization. The objective of this study is to identify the appropriate reference gene(s) for qPCR analyses of the leaves and roots of ramie (Boehmeria nivea L.), an important natural fiber crop. To accomplish this goal, we investigated the expression patterns of eight common plant qPCR reference genes in ramie leaves and roots under five abiotic stresses, five hormonal treatments, and one biotic stress. The relative expression stabilities of the eight genes were evaluated using four common but different approaches: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. Across the 11 tested conditions, ACT1 was the most stably expressed among the eight genes while GAPDH displayed the biggest variation. Overall, while variations in the suggested reference genes were found for different tissue x treatment combinations, our analyses revealed that together, genes ACT1, CYP2, and UBQ can provide robust references for gene expression studies of ramie leaves under most conditions, while genes EF-1α, TUB, and ACT1 can be used for similar studies of ramie roots.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is one of the most powerful tools to analyze the gene expression level and investigate the mechanism of insect physiology at transcriptional level. Gene expression studies utilizing qRT-PCR have been applied to numerous insects so far. However, no universal reference genes could be used for H. theivora. To obtain accurate and reliable normalized data in H. theivora, twelve candidate reference genes were examined under different tissues, developmental stages and sexes by using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, Delta Ct and RefFinder algorithms, respectively. The results revealed that the ideal reference genes differed across the treatments, and the consensus rankings generated from stability values provided by these programs suggested a combination of two genes for normalization. To be specific, RPS3A and Actin were the best suitable reference genes for tissues, RPL13A and GAPDH were suitable for developmental stages, EF1α and RPL13A were suitable for sexes, and RPL13A and RPS3A were suitable for all samples. This study represents the first systematic analysis of reference genes for qRT-PCR experiments in H. theivora, and the results can provide a credible normalization for qRT-PCR data, facilitating transcript profiling studies of functional genes in this insect.",Scientific Reports,2019

Krzyżanowska, Anna Supernat, Tomasz Maciąg, Marta Matuszewska, Sylwia Jafra","AbstractReverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), a method of choice for quantification of gene expression changes, requires stably expressed reference genes for normalization of data. So far, no reference genes were established for the Alphaproteobacteria of the genus Ochrobactrum. Here, we determined reference genes for gene expression studies in O. quorumnocens A44. Strain A44 was cultured under 10 different conditions and the stability of expression of 11 candidate genes was evaluated using geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. Most stably expressed genes were found to be rho, gyrB and rpoD. Our results can facilitate the choice of reference genes in the related Ochrobactrum strains. O. quorumnocens A44 is able to inactivate a broad spectrum of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) – the quorum sensing molecules of many Gram-negative bacteria. This activity is attributed to AiiO hydrolase, yet it remains unclear whether AHLs are the primary substrate of this enzyme. Using the established RT-qPCR setup, we found that the expression of the aiiO gene upon exposure to two AHLs, C6-HLS and 3OC12-HSL, does not change above the 1-fold significance threshold. The implications of this finding are discussed in the light of the role of quorum sensing-interfering enzymes in the host strains.",Scientific Reports,2019

It has been used to propose a ready-to-use and complete approach to mitigate the risk of technical biases in transcriptomic studies. The selection of suitable reference genes (RGs) among 29 candidates was performed using four different methods (GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and the Delta-Ct method). An overall comprehensive ranking revealed that 12 following candidate RGs are suitable for accurate normalization: gmk, proC, fabD, rpoD, nadB, rho, thrA, ribD, mutL, rpoB, adk and tmk. Some frequently used genes like 16S RNA had even been found as unsuitable to study Y. pestis. This methodology allowed us to demonstrate, under different temperatures and states of growth, significant transcriptional changes of six efflux pumps genes involved in physiological aspects as antimicrobial resistance or virulence. Previous transcriptomic studies done under comparable conditions had not been able to highlight these transcriptional modifications. These results highlight the importance of validating RGs prior to the normalization of transcriptional expression levels of targeted genes.

                Background
                Polygonum cuspidatum of the Polygonaceae family is a traditional medicinal plant with many bioactive compounds that play important roles in human health and stress responses. Research has attempted to identify biosynthesis genes and metabolic pathways in this species, and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) has commonly been used to detect gene expression because of its speed, sensitivity, and specificity. However, no P. cuspidatum reference genes have been identified, which hinders gene expression studies. Here, we aimed to identify suitable reference genes for accurate and reliable normalization of P. cuspidatum RT-qPCR data.
              
                Results
                Twelve candidate reference genes, including nine common (ACT, TUA, TUB, GAPDH, EF-1γ, UBQ, UBC, 60SrRNA, and eIF6A) and three novel (SKD1, YLS8, and NDUFA13), were analyzed in different tissues (root, stem, and leaf) without treatment and in leaves under abiotic stresses (salt, ultraviolet [UV], cold, heat, and drought) and hormone stimuli (abscisic acid [ABA], ethylene [ETH], gibberellin [GA3], methyl jasmonate [MeJA], and salicylic acid [SA]). Expression stability in 65 samples was calculated using the △CT method, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. Two reference genes (NDUFA13 and EF-1γ) were sufficient to normalize gene expression across all sample sets. They were also the two most stable genes for abiotic stresses and different tissues, whereas NDUFA13 and SKD1 were the top two choices for hormone stimuli. Considering individual experimental sets, GAPDH was the top-ranked gene under ABA, ETH, and GA3 treatments, while 60SrRNA showed good stability under MeJA and cold treatments. ACT, UBC, and TUB were suitable genes for drought, UV, and ABA treatments, respectively. TUA was not suitable because of its considerable variation in expression under different conditions. The expression patterns of PcPAL, PcSTS, and PcMYB4 under UV and SA treatments and in different tissues normalized by stable and unstable reference genes demonstrated the suitability of the optimal reference genes.
              
                Conclusions
                We propose NDUFA13 and EF-1γ as reference genes to normalize P. cuspidatum expression data. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of reference genes in P. cuspidatum which could help advance molecular biology research in P. cuspidatum and allied species.

               Global warming has dominated worldwide climate change trends, and adaptability to high temperatures is the main factor underlying the spread of the pest Calliptamus italicus in Xinjiang Province, China. However, knowledge about the molecular mechanisms responsible for this adaptability and other related biological properties of C. italicus remain relatively unclear. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a key tool for gene expression analysis associated with various biological processes. Reference genes are necessary for normalizing gene expression levels across samples taken from specific experimental conditions. In this study, transcript level of five genes (GAPDH, 18S, TUB, ACT, and EF1α), commonly used as reference genes, were evaluated under nine different temperatures (27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, and 51°C) to assess their expression stability and further select the most suitable to be used on normalization of target gene expression data. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software packages. The combined results demonstrated that the best-ranked reference genes for C. italicus are EF1α, GAPDH, and ACT under different thermal stress conditions. This is the first study that assesses gene expression analysis across a range of temperatures to select the most appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR data normalization in C. italicus.

Selection of suitable reference genes is mandatory to acquire accurate normalization of gene expression results from RT-qPCR. To select the most stable reference genes for reliable normalization of mRNA expression by RT-qPCR in the mammary gland of the Ashidan yak, we selected 16 candidate reference genes and analyzed their expression stability at different physiological stages (lactation and dry period). The expression stability of the candidate reference genes was assessed using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, Delta Ct, and RefFinder methods. The results showed that the hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene (HMBS) and the tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide gene (YWHAZ) were the most stable genes across all treatment samples. The reliability of selected reference genes was validated by normalizing relative expression of the lactation-related 60S ribosomal protein L35 gene (RPL35). The relative expression of RPL35 varied considerably according to the different reference genes.

Selection of suitable reference gene(s) for normalizations of RT-qPCR data is critical for reliable results. To date, reports on identification of suitable L. striatellus reference genes are still very limited. L. striatellus is a destructive rice pest and it can transmit multiple viruses, including Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), Rice stripe virus (RSV), and Maize rough dwarf virus (MRDV), to many important cereal crops worldwide. In this study, we examined the stablity of seven selected candidate reference genes in L. striatellus at different developmental stages, in different tissues, in RBSDV- or RSV-infected L. striatellus or in RBSDV-infected and Lssynaptojanin 1 (LsSYNJ1)-silenced L. striatellus.

The most stable reference gene for the specific condition was selected according to a comprehensive analysis using the RefFinder method. Ribosomal protein L5 (LsRPL5) and LsRPL8 are the most stably expressed genes in L. striatellus at different developmental stages. Alpha-1-tubulin (Lsα-TUB) is the most stably expressed reference gene in different tissues of RBSDV viruliferous (RBSDV-V) or non-viruliferous (RBSDV-NV) L. striatellus. LsRPL8 is the most stably expressed reference gene in RBSDV-V or RSV viruliferous (RSV-V) L. striatellus, while beta-tubulin (Lsβ-TUB) is the most stably expressed reference gene in RBSDV-V and LsSYNJ1-silenced L. striatellus. The selected reference genes were further investigated during analyses of RBSDV P5-1 and P10 gene expression in different tissues from RBSDV-V or RBSDV-NV L. striatellus.

We tested for diurnal cycles of opsin expression over a period of 24 hr at 1‐hr increments and examined how normalization affects a data set with fluctuating expression levels using qRT–PCR and transcriptome data from the retinae of the cichlid Pelmatolapia mariae. We compared five methods of normalizing opsin expression relative to (a) the average of three stably expressed housekeeping genes (Ube2z, EF1‐α and β‐actin), (b) total RNA concentration, (c) GNAT2, (the cone‐specific subunit of transducin), (d) total opsin expression and (e) only opsins expressed in the same cone type. Normalizing by proportion of cone type produced the least variation and would be best for removing time‐of‐day variation. In contrast, normalizing by housekeeping genes produced the highest daily variation in expression and demonstrated that the peak of cone opsin expression was in the late afternoon. A weighted correlation network analysis showed that the expression of different cone opsins follows a very similar daily cycle. With the knowledge of how these normalization methods affect opsin expression data, we make recommendations for designing sampling approaches and quantification methods based upon the scientific question being examined.",Molecular Ecology Resources,2019

This is especially so if a three-dimensional multicellular model prepared from liver tissues originating from biologically diverse human individuals is used. The mRNA and miRNA RGs stability were studied in thirty-five human liver tissue samples and twelve precision-cut human liver slices (PCLS) treated for 24 h with dimethyl sulfoxide (controls) and PCLS treated with β-naphthoflavone (10 µM) or rifampicin (10 µM) as cytochrome P450 (CYP) inducers. Validation of RGs was performed by an expression analysis of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on rifampicin and β-naphthoflavone induction, respectively. Regarding mRNA, the best combination of RGs for the controls was YWHAZ and B2M, while YWHAZ and ACTB were selected for the liver samples and treated PCLS. Stability of all candidate miRNA RGs was comparable or better than that of generally used short non-coding RNA U6. The best combination for the control PCLS was miR-16-5p and miR-152-3p, in contrast to the miR-16-5b and miR-23b-3p selected for the treated PCLS. Our results showed that the candidate RGs were rather stable, especially for miRNA in human PCLS.",Genes,2019

               Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become an invaluable technique for analyzing gene expression in many insects. However, this approach requires the use of stable reference genes to normalize the data. Chlorops oryzae causes significant economic damage to rice crops throughout Asia. The lack of suitable reference genes has hindered research on the molecular mechanisms underlying many physiological processes of this species. In this study, we used quantitative real-time PCR to evaluate the expression of eight C. oryzae housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), β-actin (βACT), beta-tubulin (βTUB), Delta Elongation factor-1 (EF1δ), ribosomal protein S11 (RPS11), RPS15, C-terminal-Binding Protein (CtBP), and ribosomal protein 49 (RP49) in different developmental stages and tissues in both larvae and adults. We analyzed the data with four different software packages: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder and compared the results obtained with each method. The results indicate that PRS15 and RP49 can be used as stable reference genes for quantifying gene expression in different developmental stages and larval tissues. GAPDH and βACT, which have been considered stable reference genes by previous studies, were the least stable of the candidate genes with respect to larval tissues. GAPDH was, however, the most stable reference gene for adult tissues. We verified the candidate reference genes identified and found that the expression levels of Cadherins (Cads) changed when different reference genes were used to normalize gene expression. This study provides a valuable foundation for future research on gene function, and investigating the molecular basis of physiological processes, in C. oryzae.",Journal of Economic Entomology,2019

                Background
                Cotton is one of the most important commercial crops as the source of natural fiber, oil and fodder. To protect it from harmful pest populations number of newer transgenic lines have been developed. For quick expression checks in successful agriculture qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) have become extremely popular. The selection of appropriate reference genes plays a critical role in the outcome of such experiments as the method quantifies expression of the target gene in comparison with the reference. Traditionally most commonly used reference genes are the “house-keeping genes”, involved in basic cellular processes. However, expression levels of such genes often vary in response to experimental conditions, forcing the researchers to validate the reference genes for every experimental platform. This study presents a data science driven unbiased genome-wide search for the selection of reference genes by assessing variation of &gt; 50,000 genes in a publicly available RNA-seq dataset of cotton species Gossypium hirsutum.
              
              
                Result
                Five genes (TMN5, TBL6, UTR5B, AT1g65240 and CYP76B6) identified by data-science driven analysis, along with two commonly used reference genes found in literature (PP2A1 and UBQ14) were taken through qPCR in a set of 33 experimental samples consisting of different tissues (leaves, square, stem and root), different stages of leaf (young and mature) and square development (small, medium and large) in both transgenic and non-transgenic plants. Expression stability of the genes was evaluated using four algorithms - geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder and RefFinder.
              
              
                Conclusion
                Based on the results we recommend the usage of TMN5 and TBL6 as the optimal candidate reference genes in qPCR experiments with normal and transgenic cotton plant tissues. AT1g65240 and PP2A1 can also be used if expression study includes squares. This study, for the first time successfully displays a data science driven genome-wide search method followed by experimental validation as a method of choice for selection of stable reference genes over the selection based on function alone.

However, few reference genes (RGs) for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) are available in S. viminalis, thereby limiting gene expression studies. Here, we investigated the expression stability of 14 candidate reference genes (RGs) across various organs exposed to five abiotic stresses (cold, heat, drought, salt, and poly-metals). Four RGs ranking algorithms, namely geNormPLUS, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and GrayNorm were applied to analyze the qPCR data and the outputs were merged into consensus lists with RankAggreg, a rank aggregation algorithm. In addition, the optimal RG combinations were determined with geNormPLUS and GrayNorm. The genes that were the most stable in the roots were TIP41 and CDC2. In the leaves, TIP41 was the most stable, followed by EF1b and ARI8, depending on the condition tested. Conversely, GAPDH and β-TUB, two genes commonly used for qPCR data normalization were the least stable across all organs. Nevertheless, both geNormPLUS and GrayNorm recommended the use of a combination of genes rather than a single one.

However, no systematic evaluation of reference genes in pitaya (Hylocereus undatus Britt.) has been performed. Here, we examined the expression of five candidate reference genes, namely elongation factor 1‐alpha (HuEF1‐α), 18S ribosomal RNA (Hu18S rRNA), ubiquitin (HuUBQ), actin (HuACT), and ubiquitin‐conjugating enzyme (HuUQT), under different conditions in pitaya. The expression stabilities of these five genes were evaluated using two computation programs: geNorm and NormFinder. The results were further validated by normalizing the expression of the phosphoglycerate kinase (HuPGK) and ethylene‐responsive transcription factor (HuERF) genes. Our results indicate that combined use of HuUBQ and HuUQT is the most stable reference under all of the experimental conditions examined.

Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is also used to assess target gene expression utilizing stably expressed reference genes as internal control under a given set of conditions. However, investigations of the reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization in the process of somatic embryogenesis (SE) initial dedifferentiation in Gossypium hirsutum are rarely reported. In this study, on the basis of our previous transcriptome data of three different induction stages during SE initial dedifferentiation process in four G. hirsutum cultivars that have different SE capability, 15 candidate genes were selected during SE initial dedifferentiation process, and their expression stability was evaluated by geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The results indicated that the two genes of endonuclease 4 (ENDO4) and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) showed stable expression in the four different G. hirsutum cultivars, endowing them to be appropriate reference genes during three induction stages in the four cotton cultivars. In addition, the stability and reliability of the two reference genes of ENDO4 and 18S rRNA were further verified by comparing the expressions of auxin-responsive protein 22 (AUX22) and ethylene-responsive transcription factor 17 (ERF17) between RT-qPCR results and the RNA-seq data, which showed strong positive correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.8396–0.9984), validating again the steady expression of ENDO4 and 18S rRNA as the reliable reference genes.

Considering its habitat, the fruit fly is reported to be tolerant to environmental chemicals. Quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction was employed to investigate the expression pattern and physiological function of genes putatively involved in chemical detoxification. In quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction assays, normalization of target gene expression with internal reference genes is required. These reference genes should be stably expressed during chemical exposure and in chemical‐free conditions. In this study, therefore, we used two programs (geNorm and BestKeeper) to evaluate the expression stability of five reference genes (nd, rpL18, ef1β, hsp22 and tbp) in female adult flies exposed to various concentrations of methanol and ethyl acetate. Four genes (nd, rpL18, ef1β and tbp) were found to be suitable for use as reference genes in methanol‐treated flies and three genes (ef1β, nd, tbp) were found to be suitable for use as reference genes in ethyl acetate‐treated flies.

Sarg,"Zhonghua Tu, Ziyuan Hao, Weiping Zhong, Huogen Li","The precision and reliability of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) depend mainly on suitable reference genes; however, reference genes have not yet been identified for Liriodendron chinense (Hemsl.) Sarg. In this study, the expression stability of 15 candidate reference genes, ACT7, ACT97, UBQ1, eIF2, eIF3, HIS, BIG, AGD11, EFG, GAPDH, CYP, RPL25, UBC, RPB1, and TUB, was tested across multiple organs of L. chinense using four algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. To understand the difference between the selected reference genes and the unsuitable candidate reference genes, the expression level of a target gene, LcPAT7, was normalized across various plant samples. ACT97 and eIF3 represented the best combination across all samples tested, while AGD11 and UBQ1 were unsuitable for normalization in this case. In the vegetative organ subset, ACT97, ACT7, and GAPDH showed the highest expression stability. For floral organs, UBC and eIF3 were the most stable reference genes. Unsuitable reference genes underestimated the expression levels of a target gene, LcPAT7. This study identified two reference genes (ACT97 and eIF3) for the precise and reliable normalization of L. chinense RT-qPCR data across various organs.

The identification of suitable reference genes that are not affected by the experimental conditions is a critical step in accurate normalization of the reverse transcription quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR), a commonly used assay to elucidate changes in the gene expression profile. In the present study, the effects of the cafeteria diet and sympathetic innervation on the gene expression of adrenoceptor beta 3 (Adrb3) from BAT and WAT were assessed using one of the most stable and one of the least stable genes as normalizers. Rats were fed the cafeteria diet and on the 17th day, interscapular BAT or retroperitoneal WAT was denervated and, 7 days after surgery, the contralateral innervated tissue was used as control. Ten reference genes were evaluated (18S, B2m, Actb, CypA, Gapdh, Hprt1, Rpl32, Tbp, Ubc, and Ywhaz) and ranked according to their stability using the following algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and comparative delta threshold cycle (ΔC
t) method. According to the algorithms employed, the normalization of Adrb3 expression by the least stable genes produced opposite results compared with the most stable genes and literature data. In cafeteria and control diet‐fed rats, the three most stable genes were Hprt1, Tbp, and Rpl32 for interscapular BAT and Tbp, B2m, and Hprt1 for retroperitoneal WAT, while the least stable genes were 18S, Actb, and Gapdh for both tissues.",Lipids,2019

               Gene expression studies often require reliable housekeeping (HK) genes to accurately capture gene expression levels under given conditions. This is especially true for root-knot nematodes (RKN, Meloidogyne spp.), whose drastic developmental changes are strongly dependent upon their environment. Here we utilized a publicly available M. hapla RNAseq database to identify putative HK genes throughout the nematode lifecycle. We then validated these candidate HK genes on M. incognita in order to develop a small library of suitable HK genes for RKN. Seven putative HK genes were selected for validation based on high expression level and ease of primer design. The expression of these genes was quantified by qPCR at different developmental stages to capture the entire life cycle of M. incognita which included eggs and naive infective juveniles through 3-wk post inoculation. Two algorithms, geNorm and Normfinder, identified three genes (Disu, Poly, and Skinase) constitutively and uniformly expressed throughout the entire life cycle of RKN. We believe these genes are superior HK genes suitable to be used as internal reference genes at all stages of RKN. Importantly, while we identified Actin, a commonly used HK gene, as a candidate gene within our RNAseq analyses, our qPCR results did not demonstrate stable expression throughout the nematode life cycle of this gene. This study successfully validated suitable HK genes utilizing both RNAseq data and standard qPCR methods across two species of RKN; suitable HK genes are likely applicable to other species of RKN, or even plant-parasitic nematodes. Additional lists of potential HK genes are also provided if the nematode of interest does not have homologues of the three superior reference genes described here. Gene expression studies on RKN should use validated HK genes to ensure accurate representation of transcript abundance.",Journal of Nematology,2019

Juvenile hormone analog (and its analogs such as methoprene) can induce the transformation of the worker caste into soldier caste in C. formosanus. However, several factors, such as feeding substrate and colony origin, influence the proportion of solider formation. The molecular mechanism of worker to soldier transformation of C. formosanus is still not clear. RT-qPCR is a powerful tool for molecular studies. Accurate gene quantification by the relative quantification method requires a stable expressed gene as the reference gene. However, no reference genes were available for this species in the methoprene bioassay. To study the problem of gene response to methoprene by RT-qPCR we have to first screen reference genes in C. formosanus. Workers were fed with methoprene. Termites were collected during the methoprene bioassay and separated into head and thorax+abdomen. Expression profiles of 10 candidate reference genes in the two body part types were investigated using RT-qPCR. The results were analyzed by a set of established methods (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) as well as comparative ΔCt method. Our results suggest that RPS18 is the most stably-expressed gene both in the head and thorax+abdomen for expression analysis in the methoprene bioassay of C. formosanus. The screening of suitable reference genes in C. formosanus establishes the foundation for the molecular study of soldier caste differentiation in this species.",PeerJ,2019

               Background
               Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a commonly used high-throughput technique to measure mRNA transcript levels. The accuracy of this evaluation of gene expression depends on the use of optimal reference genes. Cucumber–pumpkin grafted plants, made by grafting a cucumber scion onto pumpkin rootstock, are superior to either parent plant, as grafting conveys many advantages. However, although many reliable reference genes have been identified in both cucumber and pumpkin, none have been obtained for cucumber–pumpkin grafted plants.
            
            
               Methods
               In this work, 12 candidate reference genes, including eight traditional genes and four novel genes identified from our transcriptome data, were selected to assess their expression stability. Their expression levels in 25 samples, including three cucumber and three pumpkin samples from different organs, and 19 cucumber–pumpkin grafted samples from different organs, conditions, and varieties, were analyzed by qRT-PCR, and the stability of their expression was assessed by the comparative ΔCt method, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder.
            
            
               Results
               The results showed that the most suitable reference gene varied dependent on the organs, conditions, and varieties. CACS and 40SRPS8 were the most stable reference genes for all samples in our research. TIP41 and CACS showed the most stable expression in different cucumber organs, TIP41 and PP2A were the optimal reference genes in pumpkin organs, and CACS and 40SRPS8 were the most stable genes in all grafted cucumber samples. However, the optimal reference gene varied under different conditions. CACS and 40SRPS8 were the best combination of genes in different organs of cucumber–pumpkin grafted plants, TUA and RPL36Aa were the most stable in the graft union under cold stress, LEA26 and ARF showed the most stable expression in the graft union during the healing process, and TIP41 and PP2A were the most stable across different varieties of cucumber–pumpkin grafted plants. The use of LEA26, ARF and LEA26+ARF as reference genes were further verified by analyzing the expression levels of csaCYCD3;1, csaRUL, cmoRUL, and cmoPIN in the graft union at different time points after grafting.
            
            
               Discussion
               This work is the first report of appropriate reference genes in grafted cucumber plants and provides useful information for the study of gene expression and molecular mechanisms in cucumber–pumpkin grafted plants.

It is common to use constitutively expressed endogenous reference genes (RGs) for normalization, but for this strategy to be valid the RGs must be stably expressed across all the tested samples. Here, we have tested 10 common RGs for their expression stability in cerebral cortex from young rats after in utero exposure to thyroid hormone (TH) disrupting compounds. We found that all 10 RGs were stable according to the three algorithms geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. The downstream target gene Pvalb was significantly downregulated in brains from young rats after in utero exposure to propylthiouracil (PTU), a medicinal drug inhibiting TH synthesis. Similar results were obtained regardless of which of the 10 RGs was used for normalization. Another potential gene affected by developmental TH disruption, Dio2, was either not affected, or significantly upregulated about 1.4-fold, depending on which RG was used for normalization. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting correct RGs for normalization and to take into account the sensitivity of the RT-qPCR method when reporting on changes to gene expression that are less than 1.5-fold. For future studies examining relative gene expression in rat cerebral cortex under toxicological conditions, we recommend using a combination of either Rps18/Rpl13a or Rps18/Ubc for normalization, but also continuously monitor any potential regulation of the RGs themselves following alterations to study protocols.",PeerJ,2019

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is an optimized method for the efficient and reliable quantification of gene expression studies. In general, reference genes are used in qRT-PCR analysis because of their known or suspected housekeeping roles. However, their expression level cannot be assumed to remain stable under all possible experimental conditions. Thus, the identification of high quality reference genes is essential for the interpretation of qRT-PCR data. In this study, we investigated the expression of 14 candidate genes, including nine housekeeping genes (HKGs) (ACT2, ACT3, ACT7, CYP1, EF1-α, GAPDH, TUB-α, TUB-β, and UBC2) and five potential candidate genes (GSA, PKS1, PP2A, RPL13, and SAND). Three programs—GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper—were applied to evaluate the gene expression stability across four different plant tissues, four developmental stages and a set of abiotic stress and hormonal treatments. Integrating all of the algorithms and evaluations revealed that ACT2 and TUB-β were the most stable combination in different developmental stages samples and all of the experimental samples. ACT2, TUB-β, and EF1-α were identified as the three most applicable reference genes in different tissues and stress-treated samples. The majority of the conventional HKGs performed better than the potential reference genes. The obtained results will aid in improving the credibility of the standardization and quantification of transcription levels in future expression studies on H. perforatum.",PeerJ,2019

Researches on gene expression not only help to unravel the molecular regulatory mechanism but also identify the key genes in the biological response. RT-qPCR is a commonly used technology to quantify the gene expression. Selecting an appropriate reference gene is an effective approach to improve the accuracy of RT-qPCR assay. To our knowledge, the evaluation of reference genes under different treatments in celery has not been reported yet. In this study, the expression stabilities of eight candidate reference genes (ACTIN, eIF-4α, GAPDH, TBP, TUB-A, UBC, TUB-B, and EF-1α) under abiotic stresses (heat, cold, drought, and salt) and hormone treatments (SA, MeJA, GA, and ABA) were detected. The expression stabilities of candidate genes were compared and ranked by geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCt, and RefFinder programs. The results calculated by different programs were not completely consistent. Considering the comprehensive analysis results, ACTIN was the most stable reference gene and TUB-B showed the worst expression stabilities under the selected abiotic stress and hormone treatments in celery. The reliability of reference genes was further confirmed by the normalization of CAT1 gene under drought stress. This study presented evidences and basis to select the appropriate reference genes under different treatments in celery.",PeerJ,2019

Wyeth","Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a robust technique for the quantification and comparison of gene expression. To obtain reliable results with this method, one or more reference genes must be employed to normalize expression measurements among treatments or tissue samples. Candidate reference genes must be validated to ensure that they are stable prior to use in qPCR experiments. The pond snail (Lymnaea stagnalis) is a common research organism, particularly in the areas of learning and memory, and is an emerging model for the study of biological asymmetry, biomineralization, and evolution and development. However, no systematic assessment of qPCR reference genes has been performed in this animal. Therefore, the aim of our research was to identify stable reference genes to normalize gene expression data from several commonly studied tissues inL. stagnalisas well as across the entire body. We evaluated a panel of seven reference genes across six different tissues inL. stagnaliswith RT-qPCR. The genes included:elongation factor 1-alpha,glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,beta-actin,beta-tubulin,ubiquitin,prenylated rab acceptor protein 1, and a voltage gated potassium channel. These genes exhibited a wide range of expression levels among tissues. The tissue-specific stability of each of the genes was consistent when measured by the standard stability assessment algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. Our data indicate that the most stable reference genes vary among the tissues that we examined (central nervous system, tentacles, lips, penis, foot, mantle). Our results were generally congruent with those obtained from similar studies in other molluscs. Given that a minimum of two reference genes are recommended for data normalization, we provide suggestions for strong pairs of reference genes for single- and multi-tissue analyses of RT-qPCR data inL. stagnalis.",PeerJ,2019

In this study, the expression stability of 12 candidate reference genes of Pinus massoniana under different abiotic stresses was evaluated using four statistical algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. The results indicate that the following genes could be used as reference genes under different treatments: Actin 2 (ACT2) and F-box family gene (F-box) for salinity treatment, cyclophilin (CYP) and alpha-tubulin (TUA) for ABA treatment, actin 7 (ACT7) and CYP for drought treatment, actin 1 (ACT1) and ACT7 for cold treatment, ACT1 and CYP for heat treatment, and TUA and ACT2 for the “Total” group. To validate the suitability of the selected reference genes in this study, the Short-Root protein (SHR), Alpha-pinene synthase (APS), and Pyrabactin resistance-like protein (PYL) gene expression patterns were analyzed. The expression patterns had significant biases when the most unstable reference genes were used for normalization, compared with when the optimum reference gene or gene combinations were used for normalization.

However, suitable reference genes in RAW264.7 cells have not yet been identified for accurate gene expression quantification. In the current study, we evaluated expression levels of ten candidate reference genes in RAW264.7 cells under different conditions. RT-qPCR results indicated significant differences in the expression levels among the ten reference genes. Statistical analyses were carried out using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software to further investigate the stability of the reference genes. Integrating the results from the three analytical methods, cytochrome c-1 and hydroxymethylbilane synthase were found to be the most stable and therefore more suitable reference genes, while ribosomal protein L4 and cyclophilin A were the least stable.

The economic value of tea product largely depends on the post-harvest physiology of tea leaves. The utilization of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is a widely accepted and precise approach to determine the target gene expression of tea plants, and the reliability of results hinges on the selection of suitable reference genes. A few reliable reference genes have been documented using various treatments and different tissues of tea plants, but none has been done on post-harvest leaves during the tea manufacturing process. The present study selected and analyzed 15 candidate reference genes: Cs18SrRNA, CsGADPH, CsACT, CsEF-1α, CsUbi, CsTUA, Cs26SrRNA, CsRuBP, CsCYP, CselF-4α, CsMON1, CsPCS1, CsSAND, CsPPA2, CsTBP. This study made an assessment on the expression stability under two kinds of post-harvest treatment, turn over and withering, using three algorithms—GeNorm, Normfinder, and Bestkeeper. The results indicated that the three commonly used reference genes, CsTUA, Cs18SrRNA, CsRuBP, together with Cs26SrRNA, were the most unstable genes in both the turn over and withering treatments. CsACT, CsEF-1α, CsPPA2, and CsTBP were the top four reference genes in the turn over treatment, while CsTBP, CsPCS1, CsPPA2, CselF-4α, and CsACT were the five best reference genes in the withering group. The expression level of lipoxygenase genes, which were involved in a number of diverse aspects of plant physiology, including wounding, was evaluated to validate the findings.

Choosing appropriate reference genes for normalizing target gene expression is important for verifying expression changes. Metasequoia is a high-quality and economically important wood species. However, few systematic studies have examined reference genes in Metasequoia. Here, the expression stability of 14 candidate reference genes in different tissues and following different hormone treatments were analyzed using six algorithms. Candidate reference genes were used to normalize the expression pattern of FLOWERING LOCUS T and pyrabactin resistance-like 8. Analysis using the GrayNorm algorithm showed that ACT2 (Actin 2), HIS (histone superfamily protein H3) and TATA (TATA binding protein) were stably expressed in different tissues. ACT2, EF1α (elongation factor-1 alpha) and HIS were optimal for leaves treated with the flowering induction hormone solution, while Cpn60β (60-kDa chaperonin β-subunit), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and HIS were the best reference genes for treated buds. EF1α, HIS and TATA were useful reference genes for accurate normalization in abscisic acid-response signaling.

Reference genes have to be tested independently for each experimental set. We estimated the gene expression of five potential reference genes (Phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A, histone H3, β‐tubulin, transcription factor IIA and actin) in 33 pea (Pisum sativum L.) samples. Plant material comprised stem fragments from four pea accessions (three cultivars with different lodging susceptibility and stem stiffness and one wild‐type accession). Different phenological development stages of plants and environmental conditions were tested under three sample subsets. Phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A and β‐tubulin were the most stable genes in the subset of 30‐day plants, grown in the greenhouse. Plants at the beginning of flowering stage were grown in the greenhouse and in the field. Phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A and transcription factor IIA exhibited the most stable expression under field conditions, while histone H3 and β‐tubulin were the most stable under greenhouse conditions. Phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A and β‐tubulin were also the most stable genes among all the tested samples.

This study evaluated the expression stability of 11 candidate reference genes with different varieties, developmental periods, tissues, and abiotic stresses by using four statistical algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. The results indicated that ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme S (UBC) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (UBC E2) could be used as reference genes for different E. ulmoides varieties and tissues, UBC and histone H4 (HIS4) for different developmental periods, beta-tubulin (TUB) and UBC for cold treatment, ubiquitin extension protein (UBA80) and HIS4 for drought treatment, and ubiquitin-60S ribosomal protein L40 (UBA52) and UBC E2 for salinity treatment. UBC and UBC E2 for the group “Natural growth” and “Total”, UBA80 and UBC for the group “Abiotic stresses”. To validate the suitability of the selected reference genes in this study, mevalonate kinase (MK), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) gene expression patterns were analysed. When the most unstable reference genes were used for normalisation, the expression patterns had significant biases compared with the optimum reference gene combinations. These results will be beneficial for more accurate quantification of gene expression levels in E. ulmoides.",Scientific Reports,2018

Changes in cellular signalling is most commonly studied using the method Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Stable reference genes must be used to accurately quantify target transcript expression. The study aim was to identify suitable reference genes for normalisation of gene expression levels in normal dermal fibroblasts irradiated with either proton or photon beams. The online tool RefFinder was used to analyse and identify the most stably expressed genes from a panel of 22 gene candidates. To assess the reliability of the identified reference genes, a selection of the most and least stable reference genes was used to normalise target transcripts of interest. Fold change levels varied considerably depending on the used reference gene. The top ranked genes IPO8, PUM1, MRPL19 and PSMC4 produced highly similar target gene expression, while expression using the worst ranked genes, TFRC and HPRT1, was clearly modified due to reference gene instability.",Scientific Reports,2018

Considering the interest that tiger beetles have generated in the past years, resulting in a variety of studies, it is crucial to dispose of a validated reference gene panel for expression studies. Nine candidate genes were tested in Cicindela campestris and Calomera littoralis across several conditions and their transcription levels were assessed with geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and ΔCTmethod algorithms. Results showed high stabilities across sexes, immune challenge and gonad developmental stages for all genes tested, while body parts comparison presented less constant expression values. Only two genes are sufficient to perform a proper normalization for most of the conditions tested, except for the body parts comparison in C. littoralis, which requires the use of at least three reference genes. On the whole, no universal gene is found to be suitable for all situations, but according to the acceptable range of values, NADH, B-t, Vatpase and ArgKin seem to present the most constant expression stability, indicating their suitability as reference genes in most of the conditions. This is the first report evaluating the stability of housekeeping genes in adephagan beetles.",Scientific Reports,2018

As a prerequisite first step for future gene expression studies, we have identified and characterized a series of stable reference genes that can be used as controls for quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) expression analysis in this study. The expression stability of 15 candidate reference genes in various tissues and mature leaves under different conditions was evaluated using four different algorithms, i.e., geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder. Our results showed that SAMDC was the most stable of the selected reference genes across the set of all samples, mature leaves at different photosynthetic cycles and under drought stress, whereas RPL10A had the most stable expression in various tissues. PGK and RPS25 were considered the most suitable reference for mature leaves at different developmental stages and under cold treatment, respectively. Additionally, the gene expression profiles of sucrose transporter 4 (NcSUT4), and 9‐cis‐epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 3 (NcNCED3) were used to confirm the validity of candidate reference genes.

Watanabe","AbstractInduced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) reprogramming allows to turn a differentiated somatic cell into a pluripotent cell. This process is accompanied by many changes in fundamental cell properties, such as energy production, cell-to-cell interactions, cytoskeletal organization, and others. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) can be used as a quantitative method of gene expression analysis to investigate iPS reprogramming but it requires a validation of reference genes for the accurate assessment of target genes’ expression. Currently, studies evaluating the performance of reference genes during iPS reprogramming are lacking. In this study we analysed the stability of 12 housekeeping genes during 20 days of iPS reprogramming of murine cells based on statistical analyses of RT-qPCR data using five different statistical algorithms. This study reports strong variations in housekeeping gene stability during the reprogramming process. Most stable genes were Atp5f1, Pgk1 and Gapdh, while the least stable genes were Rps18, Hprt, Tbp and Actb. The results were validated by a proof-of-point qPCR experiment with pluripotent markers Nanog, Rex1 and Oct4 normalized to the best and the worst reference gene identified by the analyses. Overall, this study and its implications are particularly relevant to investigations on the cell-state and pluripotency in iPS reprogramming.",Scientific Reports,2018

DeLorenzo, Tae Seok Moon","AbstractRhodococcus opacus PD630 is a gram-positive bacterium with promising attributes for the conversion of lignin into valuable fuels and chemicals. To develop an organism as a cellular factory, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of its metabolism and any heterologous pathways being expressed. For the purpose of quantifying gene transcription, reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard due to its sensitivity and reproducibility. However, RT-qPCR requires the use of reference genes whose expression is stable across distinct growth or treatment conditions to normalize the results. Unfortunately, no in-depth analysis of stable reference genes has been conducted in Rhodococcus, inhibiting the utilization of RT-qPCR in R. opacus. In this work, ten candidate reference genes, chosen based on previously collected RNA sequencing data or literature, were examined under four distinct growth conditions using three mathematical programs (BestKeeper, Normfinder, and geNorm). Based on this analysis, the minimum number of reference genes required was found to be two, and two separate pairs of references genes were identified as optimal normalization factors for when ribosomal RNA is either present or depleted. This work represents the first validation of reference genes for Rhodococcus, providing a valuable starting point for future research.",Scientific Reports,2018

Howell, Subba Reddy Palli","AbstractThe brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB) is native to Asia and recently invaded the USA. RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene silencing mechanism in which the introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) inhibits gene function by degrading target mRNA. In dsRNA stability assays, the dsRNases present in the hemolymph and salivary gland secretions of BMSB showed lower activity than those in the hemolymph of Heliothis virescens. We evaluated six housekeeping genes (18S rRNA, EF1-α, Actin, Ubiquitin, 60S RP and β-Tubulin) across dsRNA treatments (injection and feeding) in nymphs and adults of BMSB and identified 18S rRNA and 60S RP as the best genes to use as a reference in reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Homologs of 13 genes that were shown to function as effective RNAi targets in other insects were identified and evaluated by injecting dsRNA targeting these homologs into BMSB adults. Five out of 13 dsRNAs tested caused more than 70% mortality by seven days after injection of dsRNA. Feeding dsRNA targeting five of these genes (IAP, ATPase, SNF7, GPCR, and PPI) to nymphs caused more than 70% mortality by three of the five dsRNAs tested. These data suggest that feeding dsRNA causes target gene knockdown and mortality in BMSB.",Scientific Reports,2018

Target gene expression is usually quantified by normalization using reference genes (RGs), and accurate normalization is critical for producing reliable data. However, stable RGs in nasal polyps and sinonasal tissues from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) have not been well investigated. Here, we used a two-stage study design to identify stable RGs. We assessed the stability of 15 commonly used candidate RGs using five programs—geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCT, and RefFinder. Ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P1 (RPLP1) and ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P0 (RPLP0) were the two most stable RGs in the first stage of the study, and these results were validated in the second stage. The commonly used RGs β-actin (ACTB) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were unstable according to all of the algorithms used. The findings were further validated via relative quantification of IL-5, CCL11, IFN-γ, and IL-17A using the stable and unstable RGs. The relative expression levels varied greatly according to normalization with the selected RGs. Appropriate selection of stable RGs will allow more accurate determination of target gene expression levels in patients with CRS.",Scientific Reports,2018

Xenopus laevis is a popular amphibian model for studying vertebrate embryogenesis and development. Further, X. laevis is ideal for studying thyroid signaling due to its thyroid dependent metamorphosis, a stage comparable to birth in humans. When using PCR based studies, a primary concern is the choice of reference genes. Commonly used references are eef1a1, odc1, rpl8, and actnB, although there is a lack of ad hoc reference genes for X. laevis. Here, we used previously published RNA-seq data on different X. laevis stages and identified the top 14 candidate genes with respect to their expression levels as a function of developmental stage and degree of variation. We further evaluated the stability of these and other candidate genes using RT-qPCR on various stages including the unfertilised eggs, whole embryos during early development and brains during late development. We used four different statistical software packages: deltaCT, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper.

Real-time PCR allows for rapid and reliable quantification of mRNA transcription. Reference genes are used as internal reaction control to normalise mRNA levels between different samples in order to allow for an exact comparison of mRNA transcription level.METHODS: In this study, twelve commonly used human reference genes were investigated in Human Embryonic Kidney Cell Lines (HEK293) using real-time qPCR with SYBR green. The genes included beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA), and tyrosine 3- monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ). The stability of these reference genes was investigated using the geNorm application.RESULTS: The range of expression stability in the genes analysed was (from the most stable to the least stable): UBC, TOP1, ATP5B, CYC1, GAPDH, SDHA, YWHAZ, CTB, 18S, EIFA-2, B2M and RPL13A. The optimal number of reference targets in the experiment was calculated to be 2 (geNorm V&lt;0.15) when comparing a normalization factor based on the 2 or 3 most stable targets).CONCLUSION: The expression stability varied greatly between the 12 candidate reference genes. UBC, TOP1, ATP5B, CYC1 and GAPDH respectively showed the highest stability in HEK293 cells based on both expression stability and expression level. Overall, our data suggest that UBC and TOP1show the least variation and the highest expression stability. This report validates the need for rational selection of reference genes for data normalization to ensure accuracy of quantitative PCR assays. ",Ethiopian Journal of Health Sciences,1970

Among the different effects of low extracellular pH on tumor cells, we have recently found that short-term exposure to acidosis strongly affects gene expression. This alteration might also occur for the most commonly used housekeeping genes (HKG), thereby causing erroneous interpretation of RT-qPCR data. On this basis, by using osteosarcoma cells cultured at different pH values, we aimed to identify the ideal HKG to be considered in studies on tumor-associated acidosis. We verified the stability of 15 commonly used HKG through five algorithms (NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, ΔCT, coefficient of variation) and found that no universal HKG is suitable, since at least four HKG are necessary for proper normalization. Furthermore, according to the acceptable range of values, YWHAZ, GAPDH, GUSB, and 18S rRNA were the most stable reference genes at different pH.

Recent studies have investigated suitable reference genes for some crustaceans under various conditions, but studies in Macrobrachium nipponense are currently lacking. In this study, we selected the following seven genes from among 35 commonly used housekeeping genes as candidate qPCR reference genes for temporal and spatial expression: EIF (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A), 18S (18S ribosomal RNA), EF-1α (elongation factor-1α), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), TUB (α-tubulin), β-act (β-actin), and RPL18 (Ribosomal protein L18). The stability of each reference gene was evaluated by GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and comparative ∆C t methods, and was comprehensively ranked using RefFinder. RPL18 was shown to be the most suitable reference gene for adult M. nipponense tissues, while EIF was the most stable in different ovarian and embryo stages and in white spot syndrome virus infection, and β-act was the most stable reference gene under hypoxia stress. The reliability of the rankings was confirmed by RNA interference experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first systematic analysis of reference genes for qPCR experiments in M. nipponense, and the results will provide invaluable information for future research in closely related crustaceans.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2018

Rosas Cárdenas","AbstractStudies of gene expression are very important for the identification of genes that participate in different biological processes. Currently, reverse transcription quantitative real‐time PCR (RT‐qPCR) is a high‐throughput, sensitive and widely used method for gene expression analysis. Nevertheless, RT‐qPCR requires precise normalisation of data to avoid the misinterpretation of experimental data. In this sense, the selection of reference genes is critical for gene expression analysis. At this time, several studies focus on the selection of reference genes in several species. However, the identification and validation of reference genes for the normalisation of RT‐qPCR have not been described in amaranth.A set of seven housekeeping genes were analysed using RT‐qPCR, to determine the most stable reference genes in amaranth for normalisation of gene expression analysis. Transcript stability and gene expression level of candidate reference genes were analysed in different tissues, at different developmental stages and under different types of stress. The data were compared using the geNorm, NormFinder and Bestkeeper statistical methods.The reference genes optimum for normalisation of data varied with respect to treatment. The results indicate thatAhyMDH, AhyGAPDH, AhyEF‐1α andAhyACTwould be optimum for accurate normalisation of experimental data, when all treatment are analysed in the same experiment.This study presents the most stable reference genes for normalisation of gene expression analysis in amaranth, which will contribute significantly to future gene studies of this species.",Plant Biology,2018

We provide here an extensive study to identify and validate suitable reference genes for gene expression analysis in the ant Atta sexdens, a threatening agricultural pest in South America. The optimal number of reference genes varies according to each sample and the result generated by RefFinder differed about which is the most suitable reference gene. Results suggest that the RPS16, NADH and SDHB genes were the best reference genes in the sample pool according to stability values. The SNF7 gene expression pattern was stable in all evaluated sample set. In contrast, when using less stable reference genes for normalization a large variability in SNF7 gene expression was recorded. There is no universal reference gene suitable for all conditions under analysis, since these genes can also participate in different cellular functions, thus requiring a systematic validation of possible reference genes for each specific condition. The choice of reference genes on SNF7 gene normalization confirmed that unstable reference genes might drastically change the expression profile analysis of target candidate genes.",Insects,2018

Only few data exist on appropriate reference genes for the human heart. The objective of this study was to determine a set of suitable reference genes in human atrial and ventricular tissues, from right and left cavities in control and in cardiac diseases.Methods and resultsWe assessed the expression of 16 reference genes (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, GUSB, HMBS, HPRT1, IPO8, PGK1, POLR2A, PPIA, RPLP0, TBP, TFRC, UBC, YWHAZ, 18S) in tissues from: right and left ventricles from healthy controls and heart failure (HF) patients; right-atrial tissue from patients in sinus rhythm with (SRd) or without (SRnd) atrial dilatation, patients with paroxysmal (pAF) or chronic (cAF) atrial fibrillation or with HF; and left-atrial tissue from patients in SR or cAF. Consensual analysis (by geNorm and Normfinder algorithms, BestKeeper software tool and comparative delta-Ct method) of the variability scores obtained for each reference gene expression shows that the most stably expressed genes are: GAPDH, GUSB, IPO8, POLR2A, and YWHAZ when comparing either right and left ventricle or ventricle from healthy controls and HF patients; GAPDH, IPO8, POLR2A, PPIA, and RPLP0 when comparing either right and left atrium or right atria from all pathological groups. ACTB, TBP, TFRC, and 18S genes were identified as the least stable.ConclusionsThe overall most stable reference genes across different heart cavities and disease conditions were GAPDH, IPO8, POLR2A and PPIA. YWHAZ or GUSB could be added to this set for some specific experiments. This study should provide useful guidelines for reference gene selection in RT-qPCR studies in human heart.",Cardiovascular Research,2017

Nicot, Johannes Fahrentrapp","AbstractReliable reference genes are critical for relative quantification using quantitative real‐time PCR (qPCR). Ten tomato genes (Solanum lycopersicum) and their respective primer sets, which have been used over the last 6 years as references in expression studies, were evaluated for their performance using leaf tissue samples grown under semi‐controlled conditions and infected with grey mould (Botrytis cinerea) or late blight (Phytophthora infestans). The target genes coding for U6 snRNA‐associated Sm‐like protein LSm7, calcineurin B‐like protein and V‐type proton ATPase were the most stable expressed of all the genes tested in three experimental repetitions. Evaluation of candidate reference genes with geNorm and NormFinder softwares yielded the lowest mean values for their respective primer sets LSM7, SlCBL1 and SlATPase, suggesting stable expression. However, SlATPase primer set revealed a comparably high intra‐group variation and was thus not considered further. In follow‐up experiments with P. infestans, the geNorm and NormFinder values of primer sets LSM7 and SlCBL1 were even lower, indicating the stability of their expression also under these conditions. Primer efficiency differed by ‐18 to +5 percentage points from values presented in the literature. Our findings show that a reference primer set which delivers the best results in one system may be outperformed by another under different experimental conditions, thus recommending a reassessment of both expression stability and qPCR efficiency whenever the biological or technical experimental set‐up is changed. On the basis of our results, we recommend the use of LSM7 and SlCBL1 as reference primer sets for gene expression studies on plant tissue derived from open or semi‐controlled conditions.",Journal of Phytopathology,2017

Samples were isolated from hypothalamus under three different nutritional status (ad libitum, fasted for 24 hr, fasted for 24 hr then refed for 2 hr). Five different algorithms were applied for the analysis of reference gene stability: BestKeeper, geNorm, NormFinder, the comparative ΔCt method, and a novel approach using multivariate linear mixed‐effects modelling for stable reference gene selection. TBP and POLR2B were identified as the two most suitable and B2M and RN18S as the two least stable reference genes for normalization. Despite our review, the current literature showing that RN18S is one of the most commonly used reference gene in chicken gene expression studies, its applicability for normalization should be evaluated before each qPCR experiment.",Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition,2017

Busulfan-induced vascular endothelial injury is an important feature after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). But the molecular mechanism of how the injured ECs affect hematopoietic reconstruction is still unknown. It is possibly through modulation of the change of some gene expression. RT-qPCR is one of the most popular methods used to accurately determine gene expression levels, based on stable reference gene (RG) selection from housekeeping genes. So our aim is to select stable RGs for more accurate measures of mRNA levels during Busulfan-induced vascular endothelial injury. In this study, 14 RGs were selected to investigate their expression stability in ECs during 72 hours of EC injury treated with Busulfan. Our results revealed extreme variation in RG stability compared by five statistical algorithms. ywhaz and alas1 were recognized as the two idlest RGs on account of the final ranking, while the two most usually used RGs (gapdh and actb) were not the most stable RGs. Next, these data were verified by testing signalling pathway genes ctnnb1, robo4, and notch1 based on the above four genes ywha, alas1, gapdh, and actb. It shows that the normalization of mRNA expression data using unstable RGs greatly affects gene fold change, which means the reliability of the biological conclusions is questionable. Based on the best RGs used, we also found that robo4 is significantly overexpressed in Busulfan-impaired ECs. In conclusion, our data reaffirms the importance of RGs selection for the valid analysis of gene expression in Busulfan-impaired ECs. And it also provides very useful guidance and basis for more accurate differential expression gene screening and future expanding biomolecule study of different drugs such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine-injured ECs.",BioMed Research International,2018

               RT-qPCR has been widely used for gene expression analysis in recent years. The accuracy of this technique largely depends on the selection of suitable reference genes. In order to facilitate gene expression analysis in wild and cultivated Cannabis, the expression stability of seven candidate reference genes (ACT2, 18S rRNA, GAPDH, UBQ, TUB, PP2A and EF1α) were assessed in leaves samples of different development stages and different organs of both wild and cultivated Cannabis in the present study. Their expression stabilities were evaluated through three software packages (GeNorm, Normfinder and Bestkeeper). Results showed that UBQ and EF1α were the highly ranked genes in different leaves samples, and PP2A was the most stable reference gene in different organs, while GAPDH was the least stable one. And the validation of the reference genes selected was further confirmed by the expression patterns of MDS and OLS.","Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry",2018

Sixteen candidate RGs of both leaf and fruit and 18 candidate RGs mostly from separate RNA-Seq datasets of bottle gourd leaf or fruit were screened and assessed by RT-qPCR. The expression stability of these genes was determined and ranked using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder. Comprehensive analysis resulted in the selection of LsCYP, LsH3, and LsTBP as the optimal RGs for bottle gourd leaves, and LsP4H, LsADP, and LsTBP for fruits. LsWD, LsGAPDH, and LsH3 were optimal for use in both leaves and fruits under the infection of CGMMV. Isopentenyl transferase (IPT) and DNA-directed RNA polymerase (DdRP) were used to validate the applicability of the most stable identified RGs from bottle gourd in response to CGMMV. All the candidate RGs performed in RT-qPCR consistently with the data from the transcriptome database.

However, suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR are often not available to investigate the expression of target genes in jellyfish under different conditions. To determine the responsible genes of jellyfish under hypoxia, primers to amplify the actin gene was designed for the amplification according to the conserved actin amino acid sequences of cnidarian. Then, we cloned and sequenced the partial cDNA sequence of Î²-actin gene containing 849 bp nucleic acids was cloned and sequenced, and the four common housekeeping genes (18S rRNA, Î²-actin, Î±-tubulin and GAPDH) were detected. To obtain suitable reference genes, we compared the four genes under normoxia and hypoxia were determined and compared using RT-qPCR. The evaluation result shows that Î±-tubulin gene can be used as single reference gene, and Î±-tubulin and Î²-actin can be served as multiple reference genes to study relative gene expression related to hypoxic tolerance of Aurelia sp.1.

There are some studies of valid endogenous control genes in the field of human glioma research, which, however, only focus on the comparison between normal brain with tumor tissue and malignant transformation toward secondary glioblastomas. Aim of this study was to validate a more general reference gene also suitable for pre- and posttreatment analysis and other evaluations (eg, primary vs secondary glioblastoma). Methods: This quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to test a panel of the 6 most suitable reference genes from other studies representing different physiological pathways (ACTB, GAPDH, POLR2A, RPL13A, SDHA, and TBP) in all common glioma groups, namely: diffuse astrocytoma World Health Organization II, anaplastic astrocytoma World Health Organization III, secondary glioblastoma World Health Organization IV with and without chemotherapy, primary glioblastoma, recurrent glioblastoma, and gliomas before and after radiation. Expression stability was tested during the longitudinal course of the disease in 8 single patients. Results: Evaluation of the expression levels of the 6 target genes showed that ACTB, GAPDH, and RPL13A show higher expression compared to SDHA, POLR2A, and TBP. ACTB, GAPDH, and RPL13A showed different expression levels between astrozytoma grade II and primary glioblastoma. Except for this difference, the candidate genes were not differentially expressed between primary and secondary glioblastomas and between the World Health Organization tumor grades. Furthermore, they remained stable before and after radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Therefore, they are adequate references for glioblastoma gene expression studies. The comparison of all tested genes resulted in SDHA and ACTB as most stable reference genes determined by the NormFinder software. Our data revealed lowest intragroup variation in the SDHA, highest in the RPL13A gene. Conclusions: All tested genes may be recommended as universal reference genes for data normalization in gene expression studies under different treatment regimens both in primary glioblastomas and astrocytomas of different grades (World Health Organization grades II-IV), respectively. In summary, ACTB and SDHA exhibited the best stability values and showed the lowest intergroup expression variability. ",Technology in Cancer Research &amp; Treatment,2018

We need to extend our basic knowledge of weeds especially in molecular genetics and gene expression. For study of gene expression by semi-quantitative and quantitative PCR, it is recommended that normalization of reference genes be carried out in order to select the most stable reference gene for a precise gene expression study. The purpose of this research was evaluation of four reference genes in response to treated and untreated (control) by herbicide in two tissues (stem and leaf) of non-target site resistance wild oat (A. ludoviciana). Four candidate reference genes including Actin, Ef1Î± (elongation factor 1 alpha), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and TBP (TATA-box-binding protein) were used to determine stable reference gene exposed to the herbicide using the statistical methods of NormFinder, BestKeeper and delta-Ct. NormFinder indicated that TBP and Actin genes are the best combination of two genes for normalizing calculations (with a combined gene stability value of 0.012) for qPCR analysis under herbicide stress in different tissues of non-target site resistance wild oat. Based on the statistical results, the Ef1Î± gene was identified as the unstable reference gene. Totally, according to results of this study, TBP gene is the most stable reference gene and therefore, this gene can be used as a reference gene for future studies of quantitative PCR analysis of herbicide stress-responsive gene expression in wild oat and potentially in other grass weed species.",Cellular and Molecular Biology,2018

In this study, we aimed to identify reference genes for studies on osteoblasts derived from rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bone marrow osteoblasts), osteoblasts derived from newborn rat calvarial (calvarial osteoblasts), and rat osteosarcoma cell line UMR‐106. The osteoblast phenotype was characterized by ALP activity and extracellular matrix mineralization. Thirty‐one candidates for reference genes from a Taqman® array were assessed by qRT‐PCR, and their expressions were analyzed by five different approaches. The data showed that several of the most traditional reference genes, such as Actb and Gapdh, were inadequate for normalization and that the experimental conditions may affect gene stability. Eif2b1 was frequently identified among the best reference genes in bone marrow osteoblasts, calvarial osteoblasts, and UMR‐106 osteoblasts. Selected stable and unstable reference genes were used to normalize the gene expression of Runx2, Alp, and Oc. The data showed statistically significant differences in the expression of these genes depending on the stability of the reference gene used for normalization, creating a bias that may induce incorrect assumptions in terms of osteoblast characterization of these cells.

However, there are no reliable studies available on selection and validation of reference genes for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) inR. apiculataphysiological tissues and in salt stress conditions. The selection of appropriate candidate reference gene for normalization of qRT-PCR data is a crucial step towards relative analysis of gene expression. In the current study, seven genes such as elongation factor 1α (EF1α), Ubiquitin (UBQ), β-tubulin (β-TUB), Actin (ACT), Ribulose1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL), Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and 18S rRNA (18S) were selected and analyzed for their expression stability. Physiological tissues such as leaf, root, stem, and flower along with salt stress leaf samples were used for selection of candidate reference genes. The high-quality expression data was obtained from biological replicates and further analyzed using five different programs such as geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, Delta Ct and RefFinder. All algorithms comprehensively rankedEF1α followed byACTas the most stable candidate reference genes inR. apiculataphysiological tissues. Moreover, β-TUBand 18S were ranked as moderately stable candidate reference genes, while GAPDH andrbcLwere least stable reference genes. Under salt stress,EF1α was comprehensively recommended top-ranked candidate reference gene followed byACTand 18S. In order to validate the identified most stable candidate reference genes,EF1α,ACT, 18S andUBQwere used for relative gene expression level of sodium/proton antiporter (NHX) gene under salt stress. The expression level ofNHXvaried according to the internal control which showed the importance of selection of appropriate reference gene.

Hildyard, Frances Taylor-Brown, Claire Massey, Dominic J. Wells, Richard J. Piercy","Background: Dogs with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy are valuable models of the equivalent human disease, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD): unlike the mdx mouse, these animals present a disease severity and progression that closely matches that found in human patients. Canine models are however less thoroughly characterised than the established mdx mouse in many aspects, including gene expression. Analysis of expression in muscle plays a key role in the study of DMD, allowing monitoring and assessment of disease progression, evaluation of novel biomarkers and gauging of therapeutic intervention efficacy. Appropriate normalization of expression data via carefully selected reference genes is consequently essential for accurate quantitative assessment. Unlike the expression profile of healthy skeletal muscle, the dystrophic muscle environment is highly dynamic: transcriptional profiles of dystrophic muscle might alter with age, disease progression, disease severity, genetic background and between muscle groups. Objectives: The aim of this work was to identify reference genes suitable for normalizing gene expression in healthy and dystrophic dogs under various comparative scenarios. Methods: Using the delta-E50 MD canine model of DMD, we assessed a panel of candidate reference genes for stability of expression across healthy and dystrophic animals, at different ages and in different muscle groups. Results: We show that the genes HPRT1, SDHA and RPL13a appear universally suitable for normalizing gene expression in healthy and dystrophic canine muscle, while other putative reference genes are exceptionally poor, and in the case of B2M, actively disease-correlated. Conclusions: Our findings suggest consistent cross-sample normalization is possible even throughout the dynamic progression of dystrophic pathology, and furthermore highlight the importance of empirical determination of suitable reference genes for neuromuscular diseases.

However, the utility of this method continues to be undermined by a number of challenges including normalization using appropriate reference genes. The need to develop tailored and effective strategies is further underscored by the burgeoning field of extracellular vesicle (EV) biology. EVs contain unique signatures of small RNAs including microRNAs (miRs). In this study we develop and validate a comprehensive strategy for identifying highly stable reference genes in a therapeutically relevant cell type, cardiosphere‐derived cells. Data were analysed using the four major approaches for reference gene evaluation: NormFinder, GeNorm, BestKeeper and the Delta Ct method. The weighted geometric mean of all of these methods was obtained for the final ranking. Analysis of RNA sequencing identified miR‐101‐3p, miR‐23a‐3p and a previously identified EV reference gene, miR‐26a‐5p. Analysis of a chip‐based method (NanoString) identified miR‐23a, miR‐217 and miR‐379 as stable candidates. RT‐qPCR validation revealed that the mean of miR‐23a‐3p, miR‐101‐3p and miR‐26a‐5p was the most stable normalization strategy.

GeNorm and NormFinder are two commonly used software packages that help in selecting the best reference genes, based on their expression stability. However, GeNorm does not take into account a group variable, such as sample sex, in its calculation. We demonstrate a simple calculation step to assess the variability of such parameters by multiplying the GeNorm M value with the difference of Cq values between groups. To test this, we used 28 reference gene candidates, to analyze 20 placental samples (10 of each sex), and by using HPRT1 (lower Cq values in male placentas (P = 0.017)), as a target gene. Our calculation demonstrates that the RPL30 – GAPDH reference gene combination is the better option to assess small placental sex differences in mRNA level, versus the selection obtained from GeNorm or NormFinder. The HPRT1 normalized mRNA expression level is different between placental sexes, using RPL30 and GAPDH as reference genes (P = 0.01), but not when using genes suggested by GeNorm or NormFinder.

The present study focused on the identification of stable housekeeping genes as a reference for analysis under different abiotic and biotic factors inP.solenopsis. We analyzed the relative expression of six commonly used candidate reference genes in different developmental stages, host-feeding assay, temperature treatments and field distribution conditions. Expression stabilities were analyzed by geNorm, NormFinder, and RefFinder. Under developmental and field distribution conditions,β-Tubulinwas found to be most stable reference genes followed byrpl32 and α-Tubulin. In the case host feeding treatment conditions,β-Tubulinandα-tubulinidentified to be the most stable reference genes, while in temperature stress, a combination ofα-Tubulinandrpl32found to be suitable for normalizing the RT-qPCR data. Further, the above-identified genes were validated using RT-qPCR based gene expression analysis of four objective genes namely,Myoinhibitory peptides(MIPs),Zinc_metalloprotease(Zn_Mp),fatty acid synthase(fas)and alpha-glucosidase. Identified reference genes will facilitate gene expression studies in future under different stress treatments inP.solenopsis.",Scientific Reports,2017

In this study, novel primers for six commonly used reference genes (AC1, TLF, Act2, TUB α, EF-1α and GAPDH) plus two new candidates (pDUF221 and RPN6) were designed and comparatively tested for expression stability under abiotic stresses (osmotic, heavy metal and heat shock) in shoot, root and their combination of Arundo donax L., a raising non-food energy crop. Expression stability rankings from the most to the least stable gene in each condition and in two tissues (young shoots and roots) were generated with geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper programs. All programs provided similar rankings and, strikingly, in most cases identified one of the new candidates, RPN6, as the most suitable reference gene. This novel set of reliable references allows to choose either the best combination of reference genes across multiple stress/organ conditions or to select condition-specific genes that can improve the quality of qRT-PCR analysis. This work provides a solid basis for the functional characterization of A. donax, by enabling accurate quantification of the transcriptional responsiveness under a series of common stress conditions of any gene of interest in this promising biomass/bioenergy species.",Scientific Reports,2017

Despite its importance, there are few studies on gene expression in this species under stressful conditions. Real-time (RT-qPCR) is an accurate technique for gene quantification analysis, but reference genes must be validated under the same conditions used to assess the expression of the target genes. Here, we evaluated the stability of nine reference genes: Actin 12, Eukaryotic initiation factor 4 A, Elongation factor-1 alpha, FTSH protease 4, U2 auxiliary fator, Succinol Co-enzyme A, Tubulin alfa-5, Tubulin beta-6, Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. Total RNA was extract from leaf tissues of U. brizantha subjected to 6, 12 and 24 h of cold and heat stresses (10 and 45 °C, respectively), and drought, including moderate (−0.5 to −0.7 MPa), severe (−1.1 to −1.8 MPa) and recovery after re-watering. The RefFinder web-based tool was used to rank the most stable reference genes for each stress. Elongation factor-1 alpha, Elongation factor-1 alpha or Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, and Eukaryotic initiation factor 4 A were the most stable genes for heat, cold and drought stress, respectively. The expression of Rubisco large subunit gene was normalized against the most stable gene selected by ReFfinder for each stress.",Scientific Reports,2017

                     a after Long-time Exposure to Cadmium","Anna Płachetka-Bożek, Maria Augustyniak","AbstractStudies on the transcriptional control of gene expression play an important role in many areas of biology. Reference genes, which are often referred to as housekeeping genes, such as GAPDH, G3PDH, EF2, RpL7A, RpL10, TUBα and Actin, have traditionally been assumed to be stably expressed in all conditions, and they are frequently used to normalize mRNA levels between different samples in qPCR analysis. However, it is known that the expression of these genes is influenced by numerous factors, such as experimental conditions. The difference in gene expression underlies a range of biological processes, including development, reproduction and behavior. The aim of this study was to show the problems associated with using reference genes in the qPCR technique, in a study on inbred strains of Spodoptera exigua selected toward cadmium resistance. We present and discuss our results and observations, and give some recommendations concerning the use and limitations of housekeeping genes as internal standards, especially in research on insects. Our results suggest that holometabolism and poikilothermia, as well as time since metamorphosis and the level of exposure to the selective factor (cadmium in this case), have a significant effect on the expression of reference genes.",Scientific Reports,2017

Duan, Subba Reddy Palli","AbstractAsian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) Anoplophora glabripennis is a serious invasive forest pest in several countries including the United States, Canada, and Europe. RNA interference (RNAi) technology is being developed as a novel method for pest management. Here, we identified the ALB core RNAi genes including those coding for Dicer, Argonaute, and double-stranded RNA-binding proteins (dsRBP) as well as for proteins involved in dsRNA transport and the systemic RNAi. We also compared expression of six potential reference genes that could be used to normalize gene expression and selected gapdh and rpl32 as the most reliable genes among different tissues and stages of ALB. Injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting gene coding for inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) into larvae and adults resulted in a significant knockdown of this gene and caused the death of 90% of the larvae and 100% of adults. No mortality of both larvae and adults injected with dsRNA targeting gene coding for green fluorescence protein (GFP, as a negative control) was observed. These data suggest that functional RNAi machinery exists in ALB and a potential RNAi-based method could be developed for controlling this insect.",Scientific Reports,2017

Measuring differences in expression levels of certain ‘resistant’ genes by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) may provide insights into molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to phosphine inC. ferrugineus, but reliable qRT-PCR results depend on suitable reference genes (RGs). We evaluated the stability of nine candidate RGs across different developmental stages and phosphine strains ofC. ferrugineus, using four softwares. The results showed thatRPS13andEF1αwere the most stable RGs, whereasα-TUBwas the least under developmental stages. Across the different strains,RPS13andγ-TUBwere the most stable RGs, whereasCycAandGAPDHwere the least. We confirmed the reliability of the selected RGs by qRT-PCR analyses of the mitochondrialcox1gene. Expression ofcox1was not significantly different in the phosphine-resistant strain compared with the phosphine-susceptible strain, but three mitochondrial genes (nad3, atp6andcob) were significantly down-regulated. These results suggest that alterations in the expressions of these three genes may be associated with phosphine resistance inC. ferrugineus. The findings will facilitate future functional genomics studies on the development and phosphine resistance inC. ferrugineus.",Scientific Reports,2017

Ascovirus-parasitoids wasp-noctuid insects constitute the dissemination system. Selection of suitable reference genes for the dissemination system could play an important role in elucidating the pathogenic molecular mechanisms of ascovirus. Unfortunately, such studies on potential reference genes in the dissemination system of ascoviruses are lacking. In the present study, we evaluated 11 candidate reference genes: β-actin1 (ACT1), β-actin2 (ACT2), elongation factor 1 (EF1), elongation factor 2 (EF2), ribosomal protein L10 (L10), ribosomal protein L17A (L17A), superoxide dismutase (SOD), 28S ribosome (28S), Tubulin (TUB) and 18S ribosome (18S). The samples were originally from various virus concentrations and points-in-time of experimental treatments using RefFinder and four algorithms. The results showed that EF1 was the most stable internal gene in S. exigua and M. similis and that EF2 was the most stable in the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line, and the stability of reference genes were confirmed via the expression levels of two inhibitor of apoptosis-like (iap-like) genes from Heliothis virescens ascovirus 3 h (HvAV-3h).

Kienesberger, Thomas Pulinilkunnil","AbstractThe global incidence of obesity has led to an increasing need for understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive this epidemic and its comorbidities. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) is the most reliable and widely used method for gene expression analysis. The selection of suitable reference genes (RGs) is critical for obtaining accurate gene expression information. The current study aimed to identify optimal RGs to perform quantitative transcriptomic analysis based on RT-qPCR for obesity and diabetes research, employing in vitro and mouse models, and human tissue samples. Using the ReFinder program we evaluated the stability of a total of 15 RGs. The impact of choosing the most suitable RGs versus less suitable RGs on RT-qPCR results was assessed. Optimal RGs differed between tissue and cell type, species, and experimental conditions. By employing different sets of RGs to normalize the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), we show that sub-optimal RGs can markedly alter the PGC1α gene expression profile. Our study demonstrates the importance of validating RGs prior to normalizing transcriptional expression levels of target genes and identifies optimal RG pairs for reliable RT-qPCR normalization in cells and in human and murine muscle and adipose tissue for obesity/diabetes research.",Scientific Reports,2017
10.1002/jnr.24089,Validation of reference genes for quantitative gene expression analysis in experimental epilepsy,"Chinmaya Sadangi, Felix Rosenow, Braxton A. Norwood","AbstractTo grasp the molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying epilepsy development (epileptogenesis) and epilepsy itself, it is important to understand the gene expression changes that occur during these phases. Quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a technique that rapidly and accurately determines gene expression changes. It is crucial, however, that stable reference genes are selected for each experimental condition to ensure that accurate values are obtained for genes of interest. If reference genes are unstably expressed, this can lead to inaccurate data and erroneous conclusions. To date, epilepsy studies have used mostly single, nonvalidated reference genes. This is the first study to systematically evaluate reference genes in male Sprague–Dawley rat models of epilepsy. We assessed 15 potential reference genes in hippocampal tissue obtained from 2 different models during epileptogenesis, 1 model during chronic epilepsy, and a model of noninjurious seizures. Reference gene ranking varied between models and also differed between epileptogenesis and chronic epilepsy time points. There was also some variance between the four mathematical models used to rank reference genes. Notably, we found novel reference genes to be more stably expressed than those most often used in experimental epilepsy studies. The consequence of these findings is that reference genes suitable for one epilepsy model may not be appropriate for others and that reference genes can change over time. It is, therefore, critically important to validate potential reference genes before using them as normalizing factors in expression analysis in order to ensure accurate, valid results.",Journal of Neuroscience Research,2017

However, this approach needs the use of endogenous reference. An improper selection of endogenous references can result in confusing interpretation of data. The aim of this study was to identify and validate appropriate endogenous reference miRNA genes for normalizing RT-qPCR survey of miRNAs expression in four different tissues of Atlantic salmon, under handling and confinement stress conditions associated to early or primary stress response. Nine candidate reference normalizers, including microRNAs and nuclear genes, normally used in vertebrate microRNA expression studies were selected from literature, validated by RT-qPCR and analyzed by the algorithms geNorm and NormFinder.

Quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR) is an important tool for ecological adaptation studies at the gene expression level. The quality of the results of qRT‐PCR analysis largely depends on the availability of reliable reference genes (RGs). To date, reliable RGs have not been determined for adaptive evolution studies in insects using a standard approach. Here, we evaluated the reliability of 17 candidate RGs for five Gynaephora populations inhabiting various altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) using four independent (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the deltaCt method) and one comprehensive (RefFinder) algorithms. Our results showed that EF1‐α, RPS15, and RPS13 were the top three most suitable RGs, and a combination of these three RGs was the most optimal for normalization. Conversely, RPS2, ACT, and RPL27 were the most unstable RGs. The expression profiles of two target genes (HSP70 and HSP90) were used to confirm the reliability of the chosen RGs. Additionally, the expression patterns of four other genes (GPI, HIF1A, HSP20, and USP) associated with adaptation to extreme environments were assessed to explore the adaptive mechanisms of TP Gynaephora species to divergent environments. Each of these six target genes showed discrepant expression patterns among the five populations, suggesting that the observed expression differences may be associated with the local adaptation of Gynaephora to divergent altitudinal environments. This study is a useful resource for studying the adaptive evolution of TP Gynaephora to divergent environments using qRT‐PCR, and it also acts as a guide for selecting suitable RGs for ecological and evolutionary studies in insects.",Ecology and Evolution,2017

In this study, nine reference genes, actin (ACT), elongation factor 1 (EF1), glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), histone (HIS), RNA polymerase II CTD phosphatase Fcp1 (RPP), succinate‐semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSD), TATA‐binding protein (TBP), ubiquitin (UBQ), and ubiquitin‐conjugating enzyme (UCE), were selected and cloned from 67‐1, and their expression stability during chlamydospore formation was determined using reverse transcription quantitative PCR and assessed using the software geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. The Ct values of the candidates ranged from 19.9 to 29.7, among which HIS, ACT and SSD exhibited high expression levels. The statistical analysis showed that ACT and SSD were most stably expressed, while UBQ and GAPDH showed relatively large variations under different culture conditions.

				 Golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) is an important economically fish species. In this study, with an aim to identify reliable reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in golden pompano, we evaluated the expression stability of eight housekeeping genes in the presence and absence of poly I:C stimulation in eight tissues. The PCR data was analyzed by geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. The results showed that the expression of all the examined genes exhibited tissue-dependent variations. When under normal physiological condition, geNorm and NormFinder identified B2M and 18S as suitable genes. When studying gene expression under conditions of poly I:C stimulation, the selection of the internal controls should be selected on a tissue basis. At 12 h stimulation, geNorm ranked Actin/UBCE, Actin/B2M, UBCE/B2M, Actin/UBCE, RPL13/B2M, UBCE/GAPDH, B2M/RPL13, and UBCE/B2M, respectively, as the most stably expressed genes in liver, spleen, kidney, gill, intestine, heart, muscle, and brain. Comparable ranking orders were produced by NormFinder. Similar results were obtained at 48 h stimulation. Taken together, these results indicate that B2M and 18S are the most stable gene across tissue types under normal physiological conditions. However, during poly I:C stimulation, no single gene or single pair of genes in the examined set of housekeeping genes can serve as a universal reference across all tissue types. If one gene is preferred, B2M, B2M, UBCE, Actin, B2M/RPL13, B2M, B2M, and RPL13 may be used in spleen, kidney, liver, gill, intestine, brain, muscle, and heart of golden pompano, respectively.",Polish Journal of Veterinary Sciences,2017

Differential gene expression analysis of a weed subjected to herbicide treatment is a key step toward more mechanistic studies. Such an analysis, often involving quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), requires suitable reference genes as internal controls. In this study, we identified optimal reference genes in the noxious weed, Japanese foxtail. This weed has evolved resistance to acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors. We analyzed the stability of eight commonly used candidate reference genes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]; ubiquitin [UBQ]; capsine phosphatase [CAP]; beta-tubulin [TUB]; eukaryotic initiation factor 4a [EIF4A]; elongation factor-1 alpha [EF1]; 18S ribosomal RNA [18S]; 25S ribosomal RNA [25S]) from root, stem, and leaf tissue of plants that were either resistant or sensitive to ACCase inhibitors, with or without herbicide stress, using qPCR.

These analyses identifiedEF1andUBQin roots,EF1,TUB,CAP, and18Sin stems, andEF1,GAPDH, and18Sin leaves as suitable references for qPCR normalization. We have identified a set of reference genes that can be used to study herbicide resistance mechanisms in Japanese foxtail.",Weed Science,2017

               Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is often used for gene expression analysis to reveal molecular mechanism of how stresses can enhance the secondary metabolites production. For RT-qPCR to be valid, robust reference genes are required. This study validated nine candidate genes as reference genes using BestKeeper, NormFinder and geNorm methods in RT-qPCR analysis of postharvest tomatoes subjected to electricity-induced stress. The most stable genes as indicated by each method were EF-1α by BestKeeper; CAC by NormFinder; and PP2Acs/TIP41 by geNorm. Due to the inconsistency in the ranking of the candidate genes by the three methods, the pairwise variation from geNorm analysis was used to calculate the minimum numbers of reference genes for an accurate normalisation and revealed that a combination of PP2Acs and TIP41 was an optimum. This reference gene combination was further validated for their stability in RT-qPCR analysis of four carotenoid-related genes, and more reliable expression levels were obtained.",International Journal of Food Science and Technology,2017

Regarding to the variation between foliage and root tissues the more stable genes were â-tubulin and 26S, while between phenological stages the best were 26S and the 1-â elongation factor. The evaluation of expression levels by absolute qPCR confirmed that the 26S gene is a stable reference for the study of gene expression based on the PCR technique due to its low coefficient of variation through contrasting abiotic stress conditions.

The expression levels of these genes were then assessed in embryos of different developmental stages and various tissue types of adult fish using quantitative real‐time (qrt‐)PCR. RefFinder algorithm was used to evaluate the expression stability of these genes based on their cycle‐threshold (Ct) values in the qrt‐PCR analysis. Results showed that there was no single best reference gene for all stages of embryos and adult tissues tested. Furthermore, it was found that, among the nine candidate genes tested, actb and tmem104 were the most stable reference genes across adult tissue types, while sep15 and tmem256 were the most stable ones across developmental stages of embryos.

Pang","AbstractQuantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has been used extensively to analyze gene expression and decipher gene function. To obtain the optimal and stable normalization factors for qRT-PCR, selection and validation of reference genes should be conducted in diverse conditions. In insects, more and more studies confirmed the necessity and importance of reference gene selection. In this study, eight traditionally used reference genes in Galeruca daurica (Joannis) were assessed, using qRT-PCR, for suitability as normalization genes under different experimental conditions using four statistical programs: geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper and the comparative ΔCt method. The genes were ranked from the most stable to the least stable using RefFinder. The optimal suite of recommended reference genes was as follows: succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA) and tubulin-alpha (TUB-α) for temperature-treated larvae; ribosomal protein L32, SDHA and glutathione S-transferase were best for all developmental stages; ACT and TUB-α for male and female adults; SDHA and TUB-α were relatively stable and expressed in different tissues, both diapause and non-diapause adults. Reference gene evaluation was validated using expression of two target genes: the P450 CYP6 gene and the heat shock protein gene Hsp70. These results confirm the importance of custom reference gene selection when studies are conducted under diverse experimental conditions.

In order to find a proper normalization strategy for the study of genes related to growth hormone signaling in skeletal muscle of growing mice, nine unrelated genes were evaluated as internal controls. According to the most used algorithms–geNorm, the Comparative ΔCq method, NormFinder and BestKeeper–GSK3B, YWHAZ, RPL13A and RN18S were found as the most stable. However, the relative expression levels of eight of the potential reference genes assessed decreased with age in cDNA samples obtained from the same amount of total RNA. In a different approach to analyze this apparent discrepancy, experiments were performed with cDNA obtained from equal amounts of purified mRNA. Since the decline was still observed, the hypothesis of an age-related change in mRNA to total RNA ratio that could account for the systematic decrease was rejected. Differences among experimental groups could be due to a substantial increase with age in highly expressed mRNAs, which would bias the quantitation of the remaining genes. Consequently, those reference genes reflecting this dilution effect, which would have been discarded considering their variable relative expression levels, arose as suitable internal controls.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2017

               While quantitative PCR (qPCR) is widely recognized as being among the most accurate methods for quantifying gene expression, it is highly dependent on the use of reliable, stably expressed reference genes. With the increased availability of high-throughput methods for measuring gene expression, whole-transcriptome approaches may be increasingly utilized for reference gene selection and validation. In this study, RNA-seq was used to identify a set of novel qPCR reference genes and evaluate a panel of traditional “housekeeping” reference genes in two species of the evolutionary model plant genus Mimulus. More broadly, the methods proposed in this study can be used to harness the power of transcriptomes to identify appropriate reference genes for qPCR in any study organism, including emerging and nonmodel systems. We find that RNA-seq accurately estimates gene expression means in comparison to qPCR, and that expression means are robust to moderate environmental and genetic variation. However, measures of expression variability were only in agreement with qPCR for samples obtained from a shared environment. This result, along with transcriptome-wide comparisons, suggests that environmental changes have greater impacts on expression variability than on expression means. We discuss how this issue can be addressed through experimental design, and suggest that the ever-expanding pool of published transcriptomes represents a rich and low-cost resource for developing better reference genes for qPCR.",G3 Genes|Genomes|Genetics,2017

Martin, Hernan G. Rosli","AbstractThe agronomical relevant tomato-Pseudomonas syringaepv.tomatopathosystem is widely used to explore and understand the underlying mechanisms of the plant immune response. Transcript abundance estimation, mainly through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), is a common approach employed to investigate the possible role of a candidate gene in certain biological process under study. The accuracy of this technique relies heavily on the selection of adequate reference genes. Initially, genes derived from other techniques (such as Northern blots) were used as reference genes in RT-qPCR experiments, but recent studies in different systems suggest that many of these genes are not stably expressed. The development of high throughput transcriptomic techniques, such as RNA-seq, provides an opportunity for the identification of transcriptionally stable genes that can be adopted as novel and robust reference genes. Here we take advantage of a large set of RNA-seq data originating from tomato leaves infiltrated with different immunity inducers and bacterial strains. We assessed and validated 9 genes that are much more stable than two traditional reference genes. Specifically,ARD2andVIN3were the most stably expressed genes and consequently we propose they be adopted for RT-qPCR experiments involving this pathosystem.",Scientific Reports,2017

Although numerous genetic expression studies utilizing quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) have been conducted with regards toAe. aegypti, a panel of genes to be used suitably as references for the purpose of expression-level normalization within this epidemiologically important insect is presently lacking. Here, the usability of seven widely-utilized reference genes i.e. actin (ACT), eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1α), alpha tubulin (α-tubulin), ribosomal proteins L8, L32 and S17 (RPL8, RPL32andRPS17), and glyceraldeyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were investigated. Expression patterns of the reference genes were observed in sixteen pre-determined developmental stages and in cell culture. Gene stability was inferred from qPCR data through three freely available algorithms i.e. BestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder. The consensus rankings generated from stability values provided by these programs suggest a combination of at least two genes for normalization.ACTandRPS17are the most dependably expressed reference genes and therefore, we propose anACT/RPS17combination for normalization in allAe. aegyptiderived samples.GAPDHperformed least desirably, and is thus not a recommended reference gene. This study emphasizes the importance of validating reference genes inAe. aegyptifor qPCR based research.",Scientific Reports,2017

NLU (also known as yeast-like symbiont, YLS). Driving by demand of novel population management tactics (e.g. RNAi), the importance of YLS has been studied and revealed, which greatly boosts the interest of molecular level studies related to YLS. The current study focuses on reference genes for RT-qPCR studies related to YLS. Eight previously unreported YLS genes were cloned, and their expressions were evaluated for N. lugens samples of different developmental stages and sexes, and under different nutritional conditions and temperatures. Expression stabilities were analyzed by BestKeeper, geNorm, NormFinder, ΔCt method and RefFinder. Furthermore, the selected reference genes for RT-qPCR of YLS genes were validated using targeted YLS genes that respond to different nutritional conditions (amino acid deprivation) and RNAi. The results suggest that ylsRPS15p/ylsACT are the most suitable reference genes for temporal gene expression profiling, while ylsTUB/ylsACT and ylsRPS15e/ylsGADPH are the most suitable reference gene choices for evaluating nutrition and temperature effects. Validation studies demonstrated the advantage of using endogenous YLS reference genes for YLS studies.",Scientific Reports,2017

Bernstein, Jean-Eric Ghia","Abstract2,4-Dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis is an experimental model that mimics Crohn’s disease. Appropriateness of reference genes is crucial for RT-qPCR. This is the first study to determine the stability of reference gene expression (RGE) in mice treated with DNBS. DNBS experimental Colitis was induced in male C57BL/6 mice. RNA was extracted from colon tissue and comprehensive analysis of 13 RGE was performed according to predefined criteria. Relative colonicTNF-αandIL-1βmRNA levels were calculated. Colitis significantly altered the stability of mucosal RGE. Commonly used glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), β-actin (Actb), or β2-microglobulin (β2m) showed the highest fluctuation within the inflamed and control groups. Conversely, ribosomal protein large P0 (Rplp0), non-POU domain containing (Nono), TATA-box-binding protein (Tbp) and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (Eef2) were not affected by inflammation and were the most stable genes.TNF-αandIL-1βmRNA levels was dependent on the reference gene used and varied from significant when the most stable genes were used to non-significant when the least stable genes were used. The appropriate choice of RGE is critical to guarantee satisfactory normalization of RT-qPCR data when using DNBS-Model.

We analyzed the stability of previously described as potential reference genes in different subsets of cardiac tissues, each representing a different field in cardiac research. The qPCR dataset was based on 119 different tissue samples derived from cardiac development to pathology in mouse adult hearts. These samples were grouped into 47 tissue types. The stability of 9 candidate genes was analyzed in each of 12 experimental conditions comprising different groupings of these tissue types. Expression stability was determined with the geNorm module ofqbase+. This analysis showed that different sets of two or three reference genes are required for analysis of qPCR data in different experimental conditions in murine cardiac research.",Scientific Reports,2017

Selection of suitable reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR is important for normalizing the expression of the key genes associated with various stresses. To validate suitable reference genes, we selected 11 candidate reference genes (five traditional housekeeping genes and six novel genes) and analyzed their expression stability in various samples, including different tissues and under different abiotic stress treatments. The expression of these genes was determined using five programs—geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCt, and RefFinder. The results showed thatα-TUB2(alpha-tubulin 2) andDnaJ(chaperone protein DnaJ 49) were the most stable reference genes across all the tested samples. We measured the expression profiles of the defense response geneSmCAT(catalase) using the two most stable and one least stable reference genes in all samples ofS. matsudana. The relative quantification ofSmCATvaried greatly according to the different reference genes.

Many of these mechanisms in insects, however, are still not well understood. One way to investigate hormonal regulation is to analyse gene expression patterns of hormones and their receptors by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). This method, however, requires stably expressed reference genes for normalisation. In the present study, we evaluated 11 candidate housekeeping genes as reference genes in samples ofLethrus apterus, an earth-boring beetle with biparental care, collected from a natural population. For identifying the most stable genes we used the following computational methods: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, comparative delta Ct method and RefFinder. Based on our results, the two body regions sampled (head and thorax) differ in which genes are most stably expressed. We identified two candidate reference genes for each region investigated: ribosomal protein L7A and RP18 in samples extracted from the head, and ribosomal protein L7A and RP4 extracted from the muscles of the thorax. Additionally, L7A and RP18 appear to be the best reference genes for normalisation in all samples irrespective of body region.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is a common technique for investigating the resistance mechanism; however, there is as yet no report on the systematic selection of stable reference genes for goosegrass. This study proposed to test the expression stability of 9 candidate reference genes in goosegrass in different tissues and developmental stages and under stress from three types of herbicide. The results show that for different developmental stages and organs (control), eukaryotic initiation factor 4 A (eIF-4) is the most stable reference gene. Chloroplast acetolactate synthase (ALS) is the most stable reference gene under glyphosate stress. Under glufosinate stress, eIF-4 is the best reference gene. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UCE) is the most stable reference gene under quizalofop-p-ethyl stress. The gene eIF-4 is the recommended reference gene for goosegrass under the stress of all three herbicides. Moreover, pairwise analysis showed that seven reference genes were sufficient to normalize the gene expression data under three herbicides treatment. This study provides a list of reliable reference genes for transcript normalization in goosegrass, which will facilitate resistance mechanism studies in this weed species.",Scientific Reports,2017

               Background
               Tibetans have lived at high altitudes for thousands of years, and they have unique physiological traits that enable them to tolerate this hypoxic environment. However, the genetic basis of these traits is still unknown. As a sensitive and highly efficient technique, RT-qPCR is widely used in gene expression analyses to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying environmental changes. However, the quantitative analysis of gene expression in blood is limited by a shortage of stable reference genes for the normalization of mRNA levels. Thus, systematic approaches were used to identify potential reference genes.
            
            
               Results
               The expression levels of eight candidate human reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, 18S RNA, β2-MG, PPIA, RPL13A, TBP and SDHA) were assessed in blood from hypoxic environments. The expression stability of these selected reference genes was evaluated using the geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper programs. Interestingly, RPL13A was identified as the ideal reference gene for normalizing target gene expression in human blood before and after exposure to high-altitude conditions.
            
            
               Conclusion
               These results indicate that different reference genes should be selected for the normalization of gene expression in blood from different environmental settings.

Two anti-Plasmodium factors of Anopheles, thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), play a role in the refractoriness of Anopheles towards Plasmodium infection and are generally expressed during infection. However, these are less studied in Anopheles dirus, a dominant malaria vector in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, most studies used a single reference gene for normalization during gene expression analysis without proper validation. This may lead to erroneous quantification of expression levels.

For accurate and reliable gene expression results, qRT-PCR assays require housekeeping genes as internal controls, which display highly uniform expression in different tissues or stages of development. However, to date no studies have validated housekeeping genes inR. venosafor use as internal controls for qRT-PCR.MethodsIn this study, we selected the following 13 candidate genes for suitability as internal controls: elongation factor-1α(EF-1α),α-actin (ACT), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1αsubcomplex subunit 7 (NDUFA7), 60S ribosomal protein L5 (RL5), 60S ribosomal protein L28 (RL28), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),β-tubulin (TUBB), 40S ribosomal protein S25 (RS25), 40S ribosomal protein S8 (RS8), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (UBE2), histone H3 (HH3), and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (PPIA). We measured the expression levels of these 13 candidate internal controls in eight different tissues and twelve larvae developmental stages by qRT-PCR. Further analysis of the expression stability of the tested genes was performed using GeNorm and RefFinder algorithms.ResultsOf the 13 candidate genes tested, we found thatEF-1αwas the most stable internal control gene in almost all adult tissue samples investigated withRL5andRL28as secondary choices. For the normalization of a single specific tissue, we suggested thatEF-1αandNDUFA7are the best combination in gonad, as well asCOX1andRL28for intestine,EF-1αandRL5for kidney,EF-1αandCOX1for gill,EF-1αandRL28for Leiblein and mantle,EF-1α,RL5, andNDUFA7for liver, GAPDH,PPIA, andRL28for hemocyte. From a developmental perspective, we found thatRL28was the most stable gene in all developmental stages measured, andCOX1andRL5were appropriate secondary choices. For the specific developmental stage, we recommended the following combination for normalization,PPIA,RS25, andRL28for stage 1,RL5andRL28for stage 2 and 5,RL28andNDUFA7for stage 3, andPPIAandTUBBfor stage 4.DiscussionOur results are instrumental for the selection of appropriately validated housekeeping genes for use as internal controls for gene expression studies in adult tissues or larval development ofR. venosain the future.",PeerJ,2017

However, the reliability and accuracy of RT-qPCR depends on accurate transcript normalization using stably expressed reference genes.Amorphophallusis a perennial plant with a high content of konjac glucomannan (KGM) in its corm. This crop has been used as a food source and as a traditional medicine for thousands of years. Without adequate knowledge of gene expression profiles, there has been no report of validated reference genes inAmorphophallus. In this study, nine genes that are usually used as reference genes in other crops were selected as candidate reference genes. These putative sequences of these genesAmorphophalluswere cloned by the use of degenerate primers. The expression stability of each gene was assessed in different tissues and under two abiotic stresses (heat and waterlogging) inA. albusandA. konjac. Three distinct algorithms were used to evaluate the expression stability of the candidate reference genes. The results demonstrated thatEF1-a,EIF4A,H3andUBQwere the best reference genes under heat stress inAmorphophallus. Furthermore,EF1-a,EIF4A,TUB, andRPwere the best reference genes in waterlogged conditions. By comparing different tissues from all samples, we determined thatEF1-α,EIF4A,andCYPwere stable in these sets. In addition, the suitability of these reference genes was confirmed by validating the expression of a gene encoding the small heat shock proteinSHSP, which is related to heat stress inAmorphophallus. In sum,EF1-αandEIF4Awere the two best reference genes for normalizing mRNA levels in different tissues and under various stress treatments, and we suggest using one of these genes in combination with 1 or 2 reference genes associated with different biological processes to normalize gene expression.

Caloric restriction (CR) is a robust lifestyle intervention to slow aging and delay onset of age-associated diseases via inducing global changes in gene expression. Reliable normalization of RT-qPCR data becomes crucial in CR studies. In this study, the expression stability of 12 candidate reference genes were evaluated in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), skeletal muscle (Sk.M) and liver of CR mice by using three algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, and Bestkeeper. Our results showed β2m, Ppia and Hmbs as the most stable genes in iWAT, Sk.M and liver, respectively. Moreover, two reference genes were sufficient to normalize RT-qPCR data in each tissue and the suitable pair of reference genes was β2m-Hprt in iWAT, Ppia-Gusb in Sk.M and Hmbs-β2m in liver. By contrast, the least stable gene in iWAT or Sk.M was Gapdh, and in liver was Pgk1. Furthermore, the expression of Leptin and Ppar-γ were profiled in these tissues to validate the selected reference genes. Our data provided a basis for gene expression analysis in future CR studies.",Scientific Reports,2016

                Introduction: Chlamydia psittaci is a gram-negative obligate intracellular pathogen of birds. Poultry infections lead to economic losses and can be transmitted to humans. No vaccine is available and the bacterium-host cell interaction is not completely understood. Replicating bacteria cause pneumonia, but C. psittaci can also be non-replicating and persistent inside the cytoplasm of avian cells. RT-qPCR provides insight into the molecular pathogenesis of both active replicating and persistent Chlamydia psittaci in birds, but requires identification of stably expressed reference genes to avoid biases. Material and Methods: We investigated the expression stability of 10 C. psittaci candidate reference genes for gene expression analysis during normal growth and penicillin-induced persistence. C. psittaci Cal10 was cultured in HeLa229 and RNA was extracted. The expression level of each candidate was examined by RT-qPCR and Cq values were analysed using geNorm. Results: The genes tyrS, gidA, radA, and 16S rRNA ranked among the most stably expressed. The final selected reference genes differed according to the bacterial growth status (normal growth versus persistent status), and the time points selected during the duration of the normal chlamydial developmental cycle. Conclusion: The study data show the importance of systematic validation of reference genes to confirm their stability within the strains and under the conditions selected.",Journal of Veterinary Research,2016

Reliable analyses using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for answering these scientific questions is heavily dependent on reliable reference genes (RGs). In this study, we evaluated stability of thirteen candidate RGs in qRT-PCR for different developmental stages and tissues of amphioxus by four independent (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and deltaCt) and one comparative algorithms (RefFinder). The results showed that the top two stable RGs were the following: (1)S20and18 Sin thirteen developmental stages, (2)EF1AandACTin seven normal tissues, (3)S20andL13in both intestine and hepatic caecum challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and (4)S20andEF1Ain gill challenged with LPS.

Normalization of results to stably expressed reference genes (RGs) is pivotal to obtain reliable results. This is especially important in relation to neurodegenerative diseases where disease-related structural changes may affect the most commonly used RGs. We analysed 15 candidate RGs in 98 brain samples from two brain regions from Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Multiple System Atrophy, and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy patients. Using RefFinder, a web-based tool for evaluating RG stability, we identified the most stable RGs to be UBE2D2, CYC1, and RPL13 which we recommend for future RT-qPCR studies on human brain tissue from these patients. None of the investigated genes were affected by experimental variables such as RIN, PMI, or age. Findings were further validated by expression analyses of a target gene GSK3B, known to be affected by AD and PD. We obtained high variations in GSK3B levels when contrasting the results using different sets of common RG underlining the importance of a priori validation of RGs for RT-qPCR studies.",Scientific Reports,2016

Goji (Lycium barbarumL.) is a multi-branched shrub belonging to the Solanaceae family. To date, no systematic screening or evaluation of reference gene(s) in Goji has been performed. In this work, we identified 18 candidate reference genes from the transcriptomic sequencing data of 14 samples of Goji at different developmental stages and under drought stress condition. The expression stability of these candidate genes was rigorously analyzed using qRT-PCR and four different statistical algorithms: geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder and RefFinder. Two novel reference genesLbCML38andLbRH52showed the most stable expression, whereas the traditionally used reference genes such asLbGAPDH, LbHSP90andLbTUBshowed unstable expression in the tested samples. Expression of a target geneLbMYB1was also tested and compared using optimal reference genesLbCML38andLbRH52, mediocre reference geneLbActin7, and poor reference geneLbHSP90as normalization standards, respectively. As expected, calculation of the target gene expression by normalization againstLbCML38, LbActin7orLbHSP90showed significant differences.

Two types of osteoporosis models were used like as mechanical unloading and estrogen deficiency. Through a large-scale screening using microarray, qPCR validation and statistical algorithms, we first identified miR-25-3p as a suitable reference gene for both type of osteoporosis, which also showed stability during the differentiation processes of osteoblast and osteoclast. Then 15 serum miRNAs with differential expression in OVX rats were identified by microarray and qPCR validation. We further detected these 15 miRNAs in postmenopausal women and bedrest rhesus monkeys and evaluated their diagnostic value by ROC analysis. Among these miRNAs, miR-30b-5p was significantly down-regulated in postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis; miR-103-3p, miR-142-3p, miR-328-3p were only significantly decreased in osteoporosis. They all showed positive correlations with BMD. Except miR328-3p, the other three miRNAs were also declined in the rhesus monkeys after long-duration bedrest. Their AUC values (all &gt;0.75) proved the diagnostic potential. Our results provided a reliable normalization reference gene and verified a group of circulating miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers in the detection of postmenopausal- and mechanical unloading- osteoporosis.",Scientific Reports,2016

Although circulating miRNAs have been regarded as potential non-invasive biomarker of disease, no study has been performed so far on reference miRNAs for normalization in colorectal cancer. In this study we tried to identify optimal reference miRNAs for qPCR analysis across colorectal cancer patients and healthy individuals. 485 blood-derived miRNAs were profiled in serum sample pools of both colorectal cancer and healthy control. Seven candidate miRNAs chosen from profiling results as well as three previous reported reference miRNAs were validated using qPCR in 30 colorectal cancer patients and 30 healthy individuals, and thereafter analyzed by statistical algorithms BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder. Taken together, hsa-miR-93-5p, hsa-miR-25-3p and hsa-miR-106b-5p were recommended as a set of suitable reference genes. More interestingly, the three miRNAs validated from 485 miRNAs are derived from a single primary transcript, indicting the cluster may be highly conserved in colorectal cancer. However, all three miRNAs differed significantly between healthy individuals and non-small cell lung cancer or breast cancer patients and could not be used as reference genes in the two types of cancer.",Scientific Reports,2016

Reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is a highly sensitive technique for transcriptome analysis, and it has been frequently used in ASD gene expression studies. However, normalization to stably expressed reference gene(s) is necessary to validate any alteration reported at the mRNA level for target genes. The main goal of the present study was to find the most stable reference genes in the salivary transcriptome for RT-qPCR analysis in non-syndromic male childhood autism. Saliva samples were obtained from nine drug naïve non-syndromic male children with autism and also sex-, age-, and location-matched healthy controls using the RNA-stabilizer kit from DNA Genotek. A systematic two-phased measurement of whole saliva mRNA levels for eight common housekeeping genes (HKGs) was carried out by RT-qPCR, and the stability of expression for each candidate gene was analyzed using two specialized algorithms, geNorm and NormFinder, in parallel. Our analysis shows that while the frequently used HKG ACTB is not a suitable reference gene, the combination of GAPDH and YWHAZ could be recommended for normalization of RT-qPCR analysis of salivary transcriptome in non-syndromic autistic male children.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2016

The aim of this study was to develop sampling and storage protocols and identify stable reference genes for gene expression studies to fully utilize the growing body of molecular knowledge of C. felis. RNA integrity was assessed in adult and larvae samples, which were either pierced or not pierced and stored in RNAlater at ambient temperature. RNA quality was maintained best in pierced samples, with negligible degradation evident after 10 days. RNA quality from non-pierced samples was poor within 3 days. Ten candidate reference genes were evaluated for their stability across four group comparisons (developmental stages, genders, feeding statuses and insecticide-treatment statuses). Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 60S ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19) and elongation factor-1α (Ef) were ranked highly in all stability comparisons, thus are recommended as reference genes under similar conditions. Employing just two of these three stable reference genes was sufficient for accurate normalization. Our results make a significant contribution to the future of gene expression studies in C. felis, describing validated sample preparation procedures and reference genes for use in this common pest.",Parasitology,2016

Due to the unavailability of complete genome sequences and relatively poor genetic background information of the Chinese fir, it is necessary to identify and analyze the expression levels of suitable housekeeping genes (HKGs) as internal reference for precise analysis. Based on the results of database analysis and transcriptome sequencing, we have chosen five candidate HKGs (Actin, GAPDH, EF1a, 18S rRNA, and UBQ) with conservative sequences in the Chinese fir and related species for quantitative analysis. The expression levels of these HKGs in roots and cotyledons under five different abiotic stresses in different time intervals were measured by qRT-PCR. The data were statistically analyzed using the following algorithms: NormFinder, BestKeeper, and geNorm. Finally, RankAggreg was applied to merge the sequences generated from three programs and rank these according to consensus sequences. The expression levels of these HKGs showed variable stabilities under different abiotic stresses. Among these, Actin was the most stable internal control in root, and GAPDH was the most stable housekeeping gene in cotyledon.

Resistance to herbicides that inhibit acetyl‐coenzyme A carboxylase and acetolactate synthase activities has recently been detected in A. fatua. The resistance may be due to mutations in the herbicide targets and/or enhanced herbicide metabolism resulting from changes in gene expression, including in genes involved in detoxifying herbicide active ingredients. To analyse gene expression, stable housekeeping genes must be experimentally determined and used for data normalisation. In this study, A. fatua plants were treated with different herbicide types and plant materials were harvested at three time points following treatment. Six candidate reference genes (18S rRNA, ACT, EF1α, GAPDH, TBP, and TUB) were selected, sequenced and analysed by RT‐qPCR. The resulting data were assessed using four algorithms from the RefFinder software to determine gene expression stability. We identified TBP and GAPDH as the most stably expressed A. fatua reference genes following herbicide treatment.",Weed Research,2016

Suitable reference genes in B. odoriphaga (Bradysia odoriphaga) have yet to be identified for normalizing target gene expression among samples by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). This study was focused on identifying the expression stability of 12 candidate housekeeping genes in B. odoriphaga under various experiment conditions. The final stability ranking of 12 housekeeping genes was obtained with RefFinder, and the most suitable number of reference genes was analyzed by GeNorm. The results revealed that the most appropriate sets of internal controls were RPS15, RPL18, and RPS18 across developmental phases; RPS15, RPL28, and GAPDH across temperatures; RPS15 and RPL18 across pesticide treatments; RSP5, RPS18, and SDHA across photoperiods; ACTb, RPS18, and RPS15 across diets; RPS13 and RPL28 across populations; and RPS15, ACTb, and RPS18 across all samples. The use of the most suitable reference genes versus an arbitrarily selected reference gene resulted in significant differences in the analysis of a target gene expression.

This method requires an appropriate reference gene to normalize mRNA levels. In this study, the expression stability of four frequently-used reference genes in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), inguinal beige adipose tissue (iBeAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) from obese and lean rats were evaluated by geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. Based on the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines, the two most stable reference genes were recommended in each type of adipose tissue. Two target genes were applied to test the stability of the reference genes. The geNorm and NormFinder results revealed that GAPDH and 36B4 exhibited the highest expression stabilities in eWAT, while 36B4 and β-actin had the highest expression stabilities in iBeAT and BAT. According to the results of the BestKeeper analysis, 36B4 was the most stable gene in eWAT, iBeAT and BAT, in terms of the coefficient of variance. In terms of the coefficient of correlation, GAPDH, 36B4 and β-actin were the most stable genes in eWAT, iBeAT and BAT, respectively. Additionally, expected results and statistical significance were obtained using a combination of two suitable reference genes for data normalization. In conclusion, 36B4 and GAPDH, in combination, are the best reference genes for eWAT, while 36B4 and β-actin are two most suitable reference genes for both iBeAT and BAT. We recommend using these reference genes accordingly.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2016

This study proposed to test the expression stability of 13 candidate reference genes in Setaria viridis, a monocot species recently proposed as a new C4 model plant. Gene expression stability of these genes was assayed across different tissues and developmental stages of Setaria and under drought or aluminum stress. In general, our results showed Protein Kinase, RNA Binding Protein and SDH as the most stable genes. Moreover, pairwise analysis showed that two reference genes were sufficient to normalize the gene expression data under each condition. By contrast, GAPDH and ACT were the least stably expressed genes tested. Validation of suitable reference genes was carried out to profile the expression of P5CS and GolS during abiotic stress. In addition, normalization of gene expression of SuSy, involved in sugar metabolism, was assayed in the developmental dataset. This study provides a list of reliable reference genes for transcript normalization in S. viridis in different tissues and stages of development and under abiotic stresses, which will facilitate genetic studies in this monocot model plant.",Scientific Reports,2016

                Objective: Relevancy of the reference genes have not been investigated in crayfish tissue samples. Various genes have been proposed for establishing a reference level to analyze qPCR results obtained in different tissue samples. However, majority of those genes have been investigated solely in mammalian species. There is no report related to the relevancy and the efficiency of those common reference genes in crayfish tissue samples yet. The primary aim of the present work is to compare the expression level of a set of reference genes in various crayfish tissue samples to establish a reliable reference gene for quantitative expression level comparisons.
               Methods: cDNA copies were synthesized by RT-PCR from equalised total RNA samples of nine different tissue samples. qPCR were performed on cDNA samples by using four different primer pairs specific for β-actin, Peptidylprolyl Isomerase B, Sarcoplasmic Calcium Binding Protein and 18S ribosomal RNA genes.
               Results: qActin2 amplified gene fragments for β-actin in all samples. Cycle time of the amplification reaction differed substantially between the investigated tissue types. A similar difference was observed between the melting curves of the products. The primer pair PPIB amplified gene fragments for Peptidylprolyl Isomerase B only in heart, muscle and intestine samples but not in the rest of the tissue samples. Further, both amplification and melting curves for heart, muscle and intestine were different. qSCP amplified some gene fragments for Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Binding Protein only in muscle, heart and ganglion samples. The 18S_1 amplified fragments for 18S. Amplification curves the samples superimposed on each other. Melting curves of the products were very similar. Variance of the obtained data was the lowest for 18S ribosomal RNA.
               Conclusion: In refer to present results; it is conceivable to propose that among all the genes investigated in the present study, expression level of ribosomal 18S RNA is the most homogeneously distributed one within the body parts of the crayfish. Further, it is minimally affected by extreme biological changes such as molting. Thus, 18S Ribosomal RNA would be suggested as a reference gene to be used when investigating tissue specific expression level of a gene in the crayfish.",Turkish Journal of Biochemistry,2016

Zhu, Z. Gong","In this study, to systematically identify the most stably expressed genes for internal reference in zebrafish Danio rerio investigations, 37 D. rerio transcriptomic datasets (both RNA sequencing and microarray data) were collected from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database and unpublished data, and gene expression variations were analysed under three experimental conditions: tissue types, developmental stages and chemical treatments. Forty‐four putative candidate genes were identified with the c.v. &lt;0·2 from all datasets. Following clustering into different functional groups, 21 genes, in addition to four conventional housekeeping genes (eef1a1l1, b2m, hrpt1l and actb1), were selected from different functional groups for further quantitative real‐time (qrt‐)PCR validation using 25 RNA samples from different adult tissues, developmental stages and chemical treatments. The qrt‐PCR data were then analysed using the statistical algorithm refFinder for gene expression stability. Several new candidate genes showed better expression stability than the conventional housekeeping genes in all three categories. It was found that sep15 and metap1 were the top two stable genes for tissue types, ube2a and tmem50a the top two for different developmental stages, and rpl13a and rp1p0 the top two for chemical treatments. Thus, based on the extensive transcriptomic analyses and qrt‐PCR validation, these new reference genes are recommended for normalization of D. rerio qrt‐PCR data respectively for the three different experimental conditions.",Journal of Fish Biology,2016

In this study, a set of six genes was selected and their stability was assessed in different life stages and female organs of Bactericera cockerelli harbouring or not the bacterial pathogen ‘Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum’ (Lso) haplotype B. The stability of each gene was determined using the BestKeeper, NormFinder and GeNorm programs. These analyses identified elongation factor‐1a, ribosomal protein subunit L5 and ribosomal protein subunit 18 as the most stable genes to analyse gene expression during the insect life stages irrespective of Lso presence; Lso haplotype B only affected their respective ranking. By contrast, a common set of normalizers could not be found amongst the different female organs tested (bacteriomes, alimentary canals and reproductive organs).",Insect Molecular Biology,2016

Tingay","AbstractPreterm newborns often require invasive support, however even brief periods of supported ventilation applied inappropriately to the lung can cause injury. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qPCR) has been extensively employed in studies of ventilation-induced lung injury with the reference gene 18S ribosomal RNA (18S RNA) most commonly employed as the internal control reference gene. Whilst the results of these studies depend on the stability of the reference gene employed, the use of 18S RNA has not been validated. In this study the expression profile of five candidate reference genes (18S RNA, ACTB, GAPDH, TOP1 and RPS29) in two geographical locations, was evaluated by dedicated algorithms, including geNorm, Normfinder, Bestkeeper and ΔCt method and the overall stability of these candidate genes determined (RefFinder). Secondary studies examined the influence of reference gene choice on the relative expression of two well-validated lung injury markers; EGR1 and IL1B. In the setting of the preterm lamb model of lung injury, RPS29 reference gene expression was influenced by tissue location; however we determined that individual ventilation strategies influence reference gene stability. Whilst 18S RNA is the most commonly employed reference gene in preterm lamb lung studies, our results suggest that GAPDH is a more suitable candidate.",Scientific Reports,2016

Lima, Cristiane Hayumi Taniguti, Iderval Sobrinho, Felipe Rafael Torres, Reinaldo Alves de Brito","AbstractThe West Indian fruit fly,Anastrepha obliqua, is an important agricultural pest in the New World. The use of pesticide-free methods to control invasive species such as this reinforces the search for genes potentially useful in their genetic control. Therefore, the study of chemosensory proteins involved with a range of responses to the chemical environment will help not only on the understanding of the species biology but may also help the development of environmentally friendly pest control strategies. Here we analyzed the expression patterns of three OBP genes,Obp19d_2,Obp56aandObp99c, across different phases ofA. obliquadevelopment byqPCR. In order to do so, we tested eight and identified three reference genes for data normalization,rpl17,rpl18andef1a, which displayed stability for the conditions here tested. All OBPs showed differential expression on adults and some differential expression among adult stages.Obp99chad an almost exclusive expression in males andObp56ashowed high expression in virgin females. Thereby, our results provide relevant data not only for other gene expression studies in this species, as well as for the search of candidate genes that may help in the development of new pest control strategies.",Scientific Reports,2016

The expression characteristics of 12 internal reference gene candidates (18S rRNA, GAPDH, ACTB, HPRT1, RPL29, HMBS, PPIA, ALAS1, TBP, PUM1, GUSB, and B2M) were assessed by RT-qPCR. The data were analyzed by three commonly used software programs: geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper.ResultsThe use of the combination of four internal reference genes was more appropriate than the use of a single internal reference gene. The optimal combination was PPIA + GUSB + RPL29 + HPRT1 for both the cell line and tissues; while the most appropriate combination was GUSB + RPL29 + HPRT1 + HMBS for the tissues.ConclusionsOur recommended internal reference genes may improve the accuracy of relative quantitation analysis of target gene expression performed by the RT-qPCR method in further gene expression research on laryngeal tumors.",PeerJ,2016

However, commonly used reference genes have variable expression levels in developing skeletal muscle. There are few reports that systematically evaluate the expression stability of reference genes across prenatal and postnatal developing skeletal muscle in mammals. Here, we used quantitative PCR to examine the expression levels of 15 candidate reference genes (ACTB,GAPDH,RNF7,RHOA,RPS18,RPL32,PPIA,H3F3,API5,B2M,AP1S1,DRAP1,TBP,WSB, andVAPB) in porcine skeletal muscle at 26 different developmental stages (15 prenatal and 11 postnatal periods). We evaluated gene expression stability using the computer algorithms geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. Our results indicated thatGAPDHandACTBhad the greatest variability among the candidate genes across prenatal and postnatal stages of skeletal muscle development.RPS18,API5, andVAPBhad stable expression levels in prenatal stages, whereasAPI5,RPS18,RPL32, andH3F3had stable expression levels in postnatal stages.API5andH3F3expression levels had the greatest stability in all tested prenatal and postnatal stages, and were the most appropriate reference genes for gene expression normalization in developing skeletal muscle. Our data provide valuable information for gene expression analysis during different stages of skeletal muscle development in mammals. This information can provide a valuable guide for the analysis of human diseases.",PeerJ,2016

Young, Julie M. Old","BackgroundReference genes serve an important role as an endogenous control/standard for data normalisation in gene expression studies. Although reference genes have recently been suggested for marsupials, independent analysis of reference genes on different immune tissues is yet to be tested. Therefore, an assessment of reference genes is needed for the selection of stable, expressed genes across different marsupial tissues.MethodsThe study was conducted on red-tailed phascogales (Phascogale calura) using five juvenile and five adult males. The stability of five reference genes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,GAPDH;β-actin,ACTB;18SrRNA,18S; 28SrRNA, 28S;and ribosomal protein L13A,RPL13A) was investigated using SYBR Green and analysed with the geNorm application available in qBasePLUSsoftware.ResultsGene stability for juvenile and adult tissue samples combined show thatGAPDHwas most stable in liver and lung tissue, and18Sin small intestine and spleen. While all reference genes were suitable for small intestine and spleen tissues, all reference genes except28Swere stable for lung and only18Sand28Swere stable for liver tissue. Separating the two age groups, we found that two different reference genes were considered stable in juveniles (ACTBandGAPDH) and adults (18Sand28S), andRPL13Awas not stable for juvenile small intestine tissue. Except for28S, all reference genes were stable in juvenile and adult lungs, and all five reference genes were stable in spleen tissue.DiscussionBased on expression stability,ACTBandGAPDHare suitable for all tissues when studying the expression of marsupials in two age groups, except for adult liver tissues. The expression stability between juvenile and adult liver tissue was most unstable, as the stable reference genes for juveniles and adults were different. Juvenile and adult lung, small intestine and spleen share similar stable reference genes, except for small intestine tissues where all reference genes were stable in adults butRPL13Awas not suitable in juveniles.",PeerJ,2016

Dowling, Dara Walsh, John C. Coffey, Patrick A. Kiely","Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) remains the most sensitive technique for nucleic acid quantification. Its popularity is reflected in the remarkable number of publications reporting RT-qPCR data. Careful normalisation within RT-qPCR studies is imperative to ensure accurate quantification of mRNA levels. This is commonly achieved through the use of reference genes as an internal control to normalise the mRNA levels between different samples. The selection of appropriate reference genes can be a challenge as transcript levels vary with physiology, pathology and development, making the information within the transcriptome flexible and variable. In this study, we examined the variation in expression of a panel of nine candidate reference genes in HCT116 and HT29 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional cultures, as well as in normal and cancerous colon tissue. Using normfinder we identified the top three most stable genes for all conditions. Further to this we compared the change in expression of a selection of PKC coding genes when the data was normalised to one reference gene and three reference genes. Here we demonstrated that there is a variation in the fold changes obtained dependent on the number of reference genes used. As well as this, we highlight important considerations namely; assay efficiency tests, inhibition tests and RNA assessment which should also be implemented into all RT-qPCR studies. All this data combined demonstrates the need for careful experimental design in RT-qPCR studies to help eliminate false interpretation and reporting of results.",F1000Research,2016

Despite several studies on gene expression,Lilium, and particularlyL. regale, has not been fully investigated regarding the evaluation of reference genes suitable for normalization. In this study, nine putative reference genes, namely18S rRNA,ACT,BHLH,CLA,CYP,EF1,GAPDH,SANDandTIP41, were analyzed for accurate quantitative PCR normalization at different developmental stages and under different stress conditions, including biotic (Botrytis elliptica), drought, salinity, cold and heat stress. All these genes showed a wide variation in their Cq (quantification Cycle) values, and their stabilities were calculated by geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. In a combination of the results from the three algorithms,BHLHwas superior to the other candidates when all the experimental treatments were analyzed together;CLAandEF1were also recommended by two of the three algorithms. As for specific conditions,EF1under various developmental stages,SANDunder biotic stress,CYP/GAPDHunder drought stress, andTIP41under salinity stress were generally considered suitable. All the algorithms agreed on the stability ofSANDandGAPDHunder cold stress, while onlyCYPwas selected under heat stress by all of them. Additionally, the selection of optimal reference genes under biotic stress was further verified by analyzing the expression level ofLrLOXin leaves inoculated withB. elliptica. Our study would be beneficial for future studies on gene expression and molecular breeding ofLilium.",PeerJ,2016

The purpose of this study is to determine stably expressed HKGs in blood of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) that can be the appropriate reference genes in relative quantification in gene expression research. Sixty blood samples were taken from four beluga whales. Thirteen candidate HKGs (ACTB,B2M,GAPDH,HPRT1,LDHB,PGK1,RPL4,RPL8,RPL18,RPS9,RPS18,TFRC,YWHAZ) were tested using RT-qPCR. The stability values of the HKGs were determined by four different algorithms. Comprehensive analysis of the results revealed that RPL4, PGK1 and ACTB are strongly recommended for use in future RT-qPCR studies in beluga blood samples. This research provides recommendation of reference gene selection, which may contribute to further mRNA relative quantification research in the peripheral blood leukocytes in captive cetaceans. The gene expression assessment of the immune components in blood have the potential to serve as an important approach to evaluating cetacean health influenced by environmental insults.",PeerJ,2016

Their osteogenic capacity has been validated in vitro and may be transferred to human cell therapy for maxillary large bone defects, as they share a neural crest cell origin with jaw bone cells. RT‐qPCR is a widely used technique to study gene expression and may help us to follow osteoblast differentiation of GSCs. For accurate results, the choice of reliable housekeeping genes (HKGs) is crucial. The aim of this study was to select the most reliable HKGs for GSCs study and their osteogenic differentiation (dGSCs). The analysis was performed with ten selected HKGs using four algorithms: ΔCt comparative method, GeNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder. This study demonstrated that three HKGs, SDHA, ACTB, and B2M, were the most stable to study GSC, whereas TBP, SDHA, and ALAS1 were the most reliable to study dGSCs. The comparison to stem cells of mesenchymal origin (ASCs) showed that SDHA/HPRT1 were the most appropriate for ASCs study. The choice of suitable HKGs for GSCs is important as it gave access to an accurate analysis of osteogenic differentiation.

Romme Christensen","AbstractQuantitative real‐time PCR (qPCR) involves the need of a proper standard for normalizing the gene expression data. Different studies have shown the validity of reference genes to vary greatly depending on tissue, cell subsets and experimental context. This study aimed at the identification of suitable reference genes for qPCR studies using different peripheral blood cell subsets (whole blood (WB) cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and PBMC subsets (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, monocytes, B cells and dendritic cells) from healthy controls (HC), patients with relapsing‐remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and interferon‐β‐treated patients with RRMS (RRMS‐IFN‐β). Eight candidate reference genes (CASC3, EEF1A1, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPLP0, UBC, UBE2D2 and YWHAZ) were analysed using normfinder and genorm algorithms to identify the most stably expressed genes. We found reference gene expression varied most across cell subsets, and less variation between the donor groups. UBE2D2 was the most stably expressed gene across both HC and RRMS patients and across cell subsets, while UBC was the most stably expressed gene between HC, RRMS and RRMS‐IFN‐β patients. UBE2D2 and HPRT1 was the most stable combination for analyses of cell subsets between HC and RRMS patients, while the combination of UBC and YWHAZ was superior for analysis of cell subsets between HC, RRMS and RRMS‐IFN‐β groups. GAPDH was generally unsuitable for blood cell subset studies in multiple sclerosis. In conclusion, we found that blood cell subsets result in marked variation in reference gene expression, and we identified suitable reference genes for studies involving PBMC subsets, RRMS patients and interferon‐β treatment.",Scandinavian Journal of Immunology,2015
